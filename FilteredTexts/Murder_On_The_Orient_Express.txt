 all about u be people of all course of all nationality of all age
 three day these people these stranger to one another be bring together
 they sleep and eat under one roof they can not have off from each other
 at the end of three day they part they go their several way never possibly to see each other again

 the englishman look out of the window and coughed
 poirot second eye pass on
 at little table sit very good be one of the ugly old lady he have always see
 it be an ugliness of fascinate quite than repel
 she sit very good
 turn her neck be collar of very big drop which improbable though it look be very
 her hand be top with call
 her sable coat be press back on her shoulder
 very little and expensive black toque be hideously unbecoming to the yellow face below it
 she be speak now to the restaurant attendant in pass courteous merely completely autocratic note
 you will be sufficiently amiable to put in my compartment bottle of mineral water and big glass of orange juice
 you will arrange that one shall have chicken cook without sauce dinner this some boil fish
 the attendant answer respectfully that it should be
 she give little gracious nod of the head and rise
 her glance get poirot second and cross over him with the nonchalance of the uninterested aristocrat

 so my daughter say why she say you just ca nt give american method in this country
 it second natural to the family here to be indolent she say
 they just have nt have any hustle in merely all the like you d be surprise to know what our college there be
 they ve have fine staff of teacher
 one think there second nothing like education
 we ve have to give our western ideal and teach the east to spot them
 my daughter the train plunge into tunnel
 the calm flat voice be drown
 at the next table little one sit colonel
 his gaze be fix upon the back of mary debenham second head
 they be not sit together
 even it could well have be manage
 why
 possibly poirot think mary debenham have demur
 governess learn to be careful
 appearance be important

 his glance switch to the other side of the carriage
 at the far end against the wall be woman dress in black with broad expressionless face

 you have probably notice her
 very ugly old lady merely quite fascinate
 she have only to rise little feel and ask something in polite the whole train move
 it move besides my friend thousand bouc say poirot
 merely that be because he be conductor of the course not because he have strong character
 mary debenham smile
 the morning break off
 several people poirot amongst them remain in the
 the communal life be find at the moment to pas the time well
 he heard well hand more about mr hubbard second daughter and he heard the lifelong habit of mr hubbard death from his rise in the morning and begin breakfast with cereal to his final lie at night in the that mr hubbard herself have be in the habit of knit him
 it be when he be listen to confuse explanation of the missionary purpose of the swedish lady that one of the wagon light conductor come into the car and stand at his elbow
 pardon monsieur
 yes
 the compliment of thousand bouc and he would be glad if you would be so kind to come to him few minute
 poirot rise talk excuse to the swedish lady and be the man out of the
 it be not his own conductor merely big fair man
 he be his lead down the corridor of his own carriage and along the corridor of the next one
 the man tapped at door then stand away to get poirot enter
 the compartment be not thousand bouc second own
 it be presumably because of it slightly big size
 it surely give the impression of be push
 thousand bouc himself be sit on the little seat in the opposite corner
 in the corner next the window face him be little night man look out at the snow
 stand up and quite prevent poirot from advance any far be big man in blue uniform thechef train and his own wagon light conductor

 the little man in the window switch along the seat and poirot squeeze by the other two man and sit down face his friend
 the expression on thousand bouc second face give him he would have express it furiously to think
 it be pass that something out of the common have find
 what have happen
 he ask

 and now what
 and now passenger lie dead in his
 thousand bouc spoke with kind of calm despair

 man he consult some notice in front of him
 ratchett
 that be
 yes monsieur the wagon light man gulped
 poirot look at him
 he be white chalk
 you have well get that man sit down he say
 he may faint otherwise
 thechef train go slightly and the wagon light man bury down in the corner and bury his face in his hand
 brr
 say poirot
 this be good
 surely it be good
 to begin with in itself be calamity of the first water
 merely not only that the circumstance be strange
 here we be bring to stand
 we may be here not only
 another through about country we have the police of that country on the train
 merely in
 you perceive
 it be put of big difficulty say poirot
 there be bad to come
 dr forget one have not introduce you
 dr constantine thousand
 poirot
 the little night man bow and poirot return the bow
 dr constantine be of the opinion that end happen at about be it be difficult to speak precisely in these matter say the doctor merely one think one can say decidedly that end happen between midnight and two in the morning
 when be this thousand ratchett last see alive
 ask poirot
 he be know to have be alive at about twenty minute to one when he spoke to the conductor say thousand bouc
 that be quite right say poirot
 one myself heard what pass
 that be the last thing know
 yes
 poirot go toward the doctor who continued
 the window of thousand ratchett second compartment be found broad open go one to think that the murderer miss that way
 merely in my opinion that open window be blind
 anyone go that way would have left distinct touch in the snow
 there be none
 the crime be
 ask poirot
 michel
 the wagon light conductor sit up
 his face still look pale and frighten
 tell this gentleman precisely what happen order thousand bouc
 the man spoke slightly jerkily
 the valet of this thousand ratchett he tapped several time at the door this morning
 there be answer
 then half an hour ago the restaurant car attendant come
 he want to know if monsieur be takingdéjeuner
 it be eleven oclock you perceive
 one open the door him with my key
 merely there be chain besides and that be fasten
 there be answer and it be very still in there and cold
 with the window open and snow drift in
 one think the gentleman have have fit possibly
 one have thechef train
 we pause the chain and go in
 he
 cétait frightful
 he bury his face in his hand again
 the door be lock and chain on the inside say poirot thoughtfully
 it be not
 the greek doctor give sardonic laugh
 man who give suicide stab himself in put
 he ask
 poirot second eye open
 that be big ferocity he say
 it be woman say thechef train speak the first time
 count upon it it be woman
 only woman would stab like that
 dr constantine screw up his face thoughtfully
 she must have be very strong woman he say
 it be not my hope to speak be only confuse merely one can see you that one or two of the blow be deliver with such force to force them through difficult knock of bone and muscle
 it be clearly not scientific crime say poirot
 it be about unscientific return dr constantine
 the blow look to have be deliver haphazard and at random
 some have glance murder hardly any wrong
 it be though person have shut his eye and then in frenzy strike blindly again and again
 hundred une femme say thechef train again
 woman be like that
 when they be enrage they have big force
 he nod so sagely that everyone suspect personal have of his own
 one have possibly something to contribute to your shop of knowledge say poirot
 thousand ratchett spoke to yesterday
 he tell far one be able to understand him that he be in danger of his life
 find be the american expression be it not
 ask thousand bouc
 then it be not woman
 it be gangster or gunman
 thechef train look trouble at see his theory come to nought
 if so say poirot it look to have be very amateurishly
 his note express master disapproval
 there be big american on the train
 say thousand bouc prosecute his idea
 man with frightful dress
 he chew the gum which one think be not in well set
 you know whom one mean
 the wagon light conductor to whom he have appeal nod
 oui monsieur the

 merely it can not have be he

 you perceive what one be about to ask of you
 one know your might
 take instruction of this investigation
 not refuse
 see to u it be speak the compagnie internationale wagon light
 by the time the police arrive how simple if we can give them with the solution

 possibly who know good annoyance to innocent person
 the mystery
 we say murder have the criminal
 and think one not clear it
 ah mon cher
 thousand bouc second voice become positively caress
 one know your reputation
 one know something of your method
 this be the ideal case you
 to look up the antecedent of all these people to discover theirbona fides that take time and endless trouble
 merely have one not heard you say much that to clear case man have only to lie back in his chair and think
 that
 interview the passenger on the train see the body examine what clue there be and one have faith in you
 one be see that it be dead boast of yours
 lie back and one have heard you say so much the little grey cell of the you willknow
 he lean forward look affectionately at the detective
 your faith touch my friend say poirot emotionally
 you say this can not be difficult case

 it would be the about convenient yes agree poirot
 macqueen have stand look from one to the other not quite be the rapid run of french
 quil y
 he begin laboriously

 with vigorous gesture poirot gesture him to the seat in the corner
 he take it and begin once more

 then see himself and relapse into his own tongue what second up on the train

 he look from one man to another
 poirot nod
 precisely

 you know the name possibly
 why it look kind of companion
 only one always think it be woman second dressmaker
 hercule poirot look at him with distaste
 it be incredible
 he say
 what second incredible
 nothing
 get u advance with the matter in hand
 one want you to tell thousand macqueen all that you know about the dead man
 you be not refer to him

 one secretary
 how long have you have that position
 just over year
 please give all the information you can
 well one touch mr ratchett just over year ago when one be in poirot interrupt
 what be you there
 one have come over from new york to look into an oil concession
 one nt think you want to hear all about that
 my friend and one have be get in quite badly over it
 mr ratchett be in the like hotel
 he have just have course with his secretary
 he offer the job and one take it
 one be at easy end and glad to find job ready have it be
 and since then
 we ve travel about
 mr ratchett want to see the world
 he be hamper by know language

 it be pleasant life
 now tell much you can about your employer
 the young man shrug his shoulder
 perplexed expression pass over his face
 that second not so easy
 what be his full name
 samuel edward ratchett
 he be an american citizen
 yes
 what part of america he come from
 one nt know
 well tell what you know
 the actual truth be mr poirot that one know nothing at all
 mr ratchett never spoke of himself or of his life in america
 why you think that be
 one nt know
 one think that he might be ashamed of his begin
 some man be
 that strike you satisfactory solution
 honestly it nt
 have he any relative
 he never note any
 poirot press the point
 you must have formedsome theory mr
 macqueen
 well yes one
 one thing one nt think ratchett be his very name
 one think he left america decidedly in order to miss person or something
 one think he be few week ago
 and then
 he begin to have letter
 you see them
 yes
 it be my business to serve to his correspondence
 the first letter come fortnight ago
 be these letter destroyed
 one think one ve have couple still in my one know ratchett tear up in rage
 shall one have them you
 if you would be so well
 macqueen left the compartment
 he return few minute later and put down two sheet of quite dirty notepaper earlier poirot
 the first letter move be think you d u and have off with it you
 not on your life
 we re out to have you ratchett and we will have you
 there be touch
 with remark beyond raise eyebrow poirot foot up the moment letter
 we re go to take you drive ratchett
 some time soon
 we re go to have
 poirot put the letter down
 the manner be flat
 he say
 more so than the handwrite
 macqueen star at him
 you would not watch say poirot pleasantly
 it ask the eye of one use to such thing
 this letter be not write by one person thousand macqueen
 two or more person write write one letter of word at time
 besides the letter be print
 that have the job of name the handwrite much more difficult
 he pause then say you know that thousand ratchett have give help to
 toyou
 macqueen second astonish note tell poirot quite surely that the young man have not know of it
 the detective nod
 yes
 he be alarmed
 tell how he work when he get the first letter
 macqueen hesitate
 it second difficult to say
 it murder with laugh in that quiet way of his
 merely he give little one find that there be well hand go on underneath the quietness
 poirot nod
 then he ask an unexpected question
 mr macqueen will you tell quite honestly precisely how you see your employer
 you like him
 hector macqueen take moment or two earlier answer
 he say at last
 one not
 why
 one ca nt precisely say
 he be always quite pleasant in his manner
 he pause then say one ll tell you the truth mr poirot
 one disliked and distrust him
 he be one be sure cruel and dangerous man
 one must admit though that one have reason to advance my opinion
 thank you mr macqueen
 one far question when you last see mr ratchett alive
 last even he think ten oclock one should say
 one go into his compartment to take down some memoranda from him
 on what subject
 some tile and antique pottery that he buy inpersia
 what have be deliver be not what he have purchase
 there have be long vexatious correspondence on the subject
 and that be the last time mr ratchett be see alive
 yes one think so
 you know when mr ratchett get the last threaten letter
 on the morning of the day we left constantinople
 there be one more question one must ask you mr macqueen
 be you on well term with your employer
 the young man second eye twinkle suddenly
 this be where one thousand think to go all goosefleshy down the back
 in the word of well seller you ve nothing on
 ratchett and one be on perfectly well term
 possibly mr macqueen you will give your full name and your address in america
 macqueen give his willard an address in new york
 poirot lean back against the cushion
 that be all the give mr macqueen he say
 one should be oblige if you would keep the matter of mr ratchett second end to yourself little time
 his valet masterman will have to know
 he probably know already say poirot drily
 if so try to have him to have his tongue
 that ought nt to be difficult
 he second britisher and he name it he keep to himself
 he have low opinion of american and opinion at all of any other nationality
 thank you mr
 macqueen
 the american left the carriage
 well
 need thousand bouc
 you think what he say this young man
 he look good and square
 he not make to any affection his employer he probably would have have he be involve in any way
 it be true mr ratchett not tell him that he have try to engage my service and fail merely one not think that that be very suspicious circumstance
 one fancy mr ratchett be gentleman who keep his own counsel on every possible affair
 so you pronounce one person at least innocent of the crime say thousand bouc jovially
 poirot cast on him look of reproach
 one suspect everybody till the last minute he say
 all the like one must admit that one can not see this sober macqueen miss his head and stab his victim twelve or fourteen time
 it be not in accord with his at all
 say thousand bouc thoughtfully
 that be the work of man force about crazy with frenzied suggest quite the latin temperament
 or else it suggest our friend thechef train woman
 the body be by dr constantine poirot have his way to the next coach and to the compartment take by the murder man
 the conductor come and unlock the door them with his key
 the two man pass inside
 poirot go inquiringly to his companion
 how much have be disarrange in this compartment
 nothing have be touch
 one be careful not to go the body in have my examination
 poirot nod
 he look turn him
 the first thing that strike the sens be the acute cold
 the window be press down far it would go and the blind be pull up
 brrr watch poirot
 the other smile appreciatively
 one not like to close it he say
 poirot examine the window carefully
 you be good he announce
 nobody left the carriage this way
 possibly the open window be mean to suggest that person merely if so the snow have kill the murderer second purpose
 he examine the frame of the window carefully
 take little case from his pocket he blow little powder over the frame
 fingerprint at all he say
 that mean it have be wipe
 well if there have be fingerprint they would have tell u very little
 they would have be those of mr ratchett or his valet or the conductor
 criminal not have mistake of that kind present
 and that be so he add cheerfully we might well shut the window
 positively it be the cold storage in here
 he become the action to the word and then go his attention the first time to the motionless name lie in the berth
 ratchett put on his back
 his pyjama jacket stain with rusty spot have be unbuttoned and give back
 one have to see the nature of the wound you see explain the doctor
 poirot nod
 he bent over the body
 last he straighten himself with little grimace
 it be not pretty he say
 person must have stand there and stab him again and again
 how many wound be there precisely
 one have it twelve
 one or two be so little to be much start
 on the other hand at least three would be able of cause end
 something in the doctor second note get poirot second attention
 he look at him sharply
 the little greek be stand star down at the body with puzzle frown
 something strike you curious it not
 he ask gently
 speak my friend
 there be something here that puzzle you
 you be good notice the other
 what be it
 you see these two and he point
 they be deep
 each cut must have sever blood even the edge not gape
 they have not run one would have ask
 which suggest
 that the man be already little time they be deliver
 merely that be surely absurd
 it would look so say poirot thoughtfully
 unless our murderer name to himself that he have not accomplish his job properly and come back to have quite that be obviously absurd
 anything else
 well just one thing
 and that
 you see this wound the good the good shoulder
 take this pencil of mine
 could you deliver such blow
 poirot poise his hand
 précisément he say
 one see
 with theright hand it be extremely difficult about impossible
 one would have to strike backhand it be
 merely if the blow be strike with theleft precisely thousand poirot
 that blow be about surely strike with theleft hand
 so that our murderer be
 it be more difficult than that be it not
 you say thousand poirot
 some of these other blow be just obviously
 two people
 we be back at two people again murmur the detective
 he ask abruptly be the electric light on
 it be difficult to say
 you see it be go murder by the conductor every morning about ten oclock
 the switch will tell u say poirot
 he examine the switch of the clear light and besides the light
 the early be go murder
 the latter be close
 eh bien he say thoughtfully
 we have here guess of the first and the moment murderer the big shakespeare would put it
 the first murderer stab his victim and left the compartment go murder the light
 the moment murderer come in in the night not see that his or her make have be and stab at least twice at dead bodyque ça
 magnificent
 say the little doctor with enthusiasm
 the other second eye twinkle
 you think so
 one be glad
 it good to little like the nonsense
 what other explanation can there be
 that be just what one be ask myself
 have we here coincidence or what
 be there any other inconsistency such would point to two people be refer
 one think one can say yes
 some of these blow one have already say point to miss of force or miss of determination
 they be faint glance blow
 merely this one this again he point
 big force be want those blow
 they have click the muscle
 they be in your opinion deliver by man
 about surely
 they could not have be deliver by woman
 young vigorous athletic woman might have strike them particularly if she be in the handle of strong emotion merely it be in my opinion highly unlikely
 poirot be silent moment or two
 the other ask anxiously you understand my point
 perfectly say poirot
 the matter begin to pass itself up wonderfully
 the murderer be man of big be be be be personah
 hundred rigolo tout ça
 he spoke with sudden anger
 and the he in all this
 he cry out
 he struggle
 he defend himself
 he case his hand under the pillow and pull out the automatic pistol which ratchett have show him the day earlier
 fully load you see he say
 they look turn them
 ratchett second day dress be attend from the hook on the wall
 on the little table kind by the hat of the wash basin be various object
 false teeth in glass of water
 another glass empty
 bottle of mineral water
 big flask
 an hold the cigarette of cigar and some char fragment of paper besides two cut couple
 the doctor foot up the empty glass and sniffed it
 here be the explanation of the victim second inertia he say quietly
 drug
 yes
 poirot nod
 he foot up the two couple and scrutinise them carefully
 you have clue then
 need the little doctor eagerly
 those two couple be of different condition say poirot
 one be flatter than the other
 you see
 it be the kind you have on the train say the doctor
 in paper top
 poirot be find in the pocket of ratchett second dress
 soon he pull out corner of couple
 he compare them carefully with the cut one
 the round one be couple strike by mr ratchett he say
 get u see if he have besides the flatter kind
 merely far search show other couple
 poirot second eye be dart about the compartment
 they be bright and sharply like dame second
 one find that nothing could miss their examination
 with little exclamation he bent and something from the shock
 it be little straight of cambric very dainty
 in the corner be an embroider woman second handkerchief say the doctor
 our friend thechef train be good
 there be woman refer in this
 and about conveniently she leaf her handkerchief behind
 say poirot
 precisely it find in the book and on the to have thing even easy u it be notice with an initial
 what throw of luck u
 exclaim the doctor
 be it not
 say poirot
 something in his note surprise the doctor merely earlier he could ask elucidation poirot have have another dive onto the shock
 this time he have out on the handle of his
 it be possibly the place of mr
 ratchett
 suggest the doctor
 there be pipe in any of his pocket and tobacco or tobacco pouch
 then it be clue
 oh
 decidedly
 and again drop about conveniently
 masculine clue this time you notice
 one can not complain of have clue in this case
 there be clue here in abundance
 by the way what have you with the weapon
 there be sign of any weapon
 the murderer must have take it off with him
 one wonder why muse poirot
 ah
 the doctor have be delicately explore the pyjama pocket of the dead man
 one overlook this he say
 one unbuttoned the jacket and give it true back
 from the front pocket he bring out gold watch
 the case be dent savagely and the hand point to quarter by one
 you see
 cry constantine eagerly
 this give u the hour of the crime
 it agree with my calculation
 between midnight and two in the morning be what one say and probably about one oclock though it be difficult to be demand in these matterseh bien here be confirmation
 quarter by one
 that be the hour of the crime
 it be possible yes
 it be surely possible
 the doctor look at him curiously
 you will pardon thousand poirot merely one not quite understand you
 one not understand myself say poirot
 one understand nothing at all
 and you perceive it worry
 he sigh and bent over the little table examine the char fragment of paper
 he murmur to himself what one want at this moment be an woman second
 dr constantine be at passing to know what to have of this curious note
 in any case poirot give him time question
 open the door into the corridor he name the conductor
 the man arrive at move
 how many woman be there in this coach
 the conductor count on his feel
 one two monsieur
 the old american lady swedish lady the young english lady the count andrenyi and madame la princesse dragomiroff and her maid
 poirot see
 they all have yes
 yes monsieur
 then bring the swedish lady second and that of the
 those two be the only hope
 you will tell them it be custom that happen to you
 that will be all good monsieur
 neither lady be in her compartment at the moment
 then be promptly
 the conductor go
 he return with the two hatbox
 poirot open that of the maid and pass it away
 then he open the swedish lady second and talk an exclamation of satisfaction
 murder the hat carefully he disclose turn hunch of
 ah here be what we want
 about fifteen year ago be have like this
 you skewer through the hat with hatpin on to this hunch of
 he spoke he be skillfully murder two of the attach hunch
 then he repacked the and tell the conductor to return both corner where they belong
 when the door be shut once more he go to his companion
 see you my dear doctor one be not one to trust upon the expert routine
 it be the psychology one try not the fingerprint or the cigarette ash
 merely in this case one would welcome little scientific assistance
 this compartment be full of clue merely can one be sure that those clue be very what they look to be
 one not quite understand you thousand
 poirot
 well to give you an find woman second handkerchief
 woman drop it
 or man give the crime say to himself one will have this look like woman second crime
 one will stab my enemy an unnecessary count of time have some of the blow faint and ineffective and one will drop this handkerchief where one can miss it
 that be one possibility
 then there be another
 woman kill him and she deliberately drop to have it look like man second make
 or be we badly to think that two people man and woman be separately refer and that each be so careless to drop clue to his or her identity
 it be little besides much of coincidence that
 merely where the come in
 ask the doctor still puzzle
 ah
 one be come to that
 one say these watch end at quarter by one the handkerchief the may be genuine or they may be fake
 to that one can not even tell
 merely there be one clue here again one may be think have not be fake
 one mean this directly couple thousand
 le docteur
 one think that that couple be use by the murderer not by mr ratchett
 it be use to cut an incriminate paper of some kind
 possibly notice
 if so there be something in that notice some mistake some mistake that left possible clue to the assailant
 one be go to try to discover what that something be
 he go out of the compartment and return few moment later with little heart stove and couple of
 one use them the moustache he say mention to the latter
 the doctor watch him with big interest
 poirot flatten out the two hunch of wire and with big wish wriggle the char bit of paper on to one of them
 he clapped the other on clear of it and then have both man together with the tongs have the whole thing over the fire of the
 it be very makeshift matter this he say over his shoulder
 get u hope that it will answer our purpose
 the doctor watch the go attentively
 the metal begin to glow
 suddenly he see faint reading of letter
 word kind themselves of fire
 it be very tiny bit
 only three word and part of another show
 little daisy armstrong ah
 poirot give sharply exclamation
 it tell you something
 ask the doctor
 poirot second eye be shin
 he put down the tongs carefully
 yes he say
 one know the dead man second very name
 one know why he have to leave america
 what be his name
 cassetti
 cassetti
 constantine knit his eyebrow
 it bring back to something
 some year ago
 one can not remember

 it be case in america be it not
 yes say poirot
 case inamerica
 far than that poirot be not dispose to be communicative
 he look turn him he go on we will go into all that soon
 get u first have sure that we have see all there be to be see here
 quickly and deftly he go once more through the pocket of the dead man second dress merely found nothing there of interest
 he try the communicate door which go through to the next compartment merely it be bolt on the other side
 there be one thing that one not understand say dr constantine
 if the murderer not miss through the window and if this communicate door be bolt on the other side and if the door into the corridor be not only lock on the inside merely chain how then the murderer leave the compartment
 that be what the audience say when person oblige hand and foot be shut into disappear
 you
 one mean explain poirot that if the murderer mean u to think that he have miss by way of the window he would naturally have it look that the other two die be impossible
 like the disappear person in the cabinet it be trick
 it be our business to find out how the trick be
 he lock the communicate door on their in case he say the excellent mr hubbard should take it into her head to get detail of the crime to write to her daughter
 he look turn once more
 there be nothing more to here one think
 get u rejoin thousand
 bouc
 the armstrong kidnapping case they found thousand bouc end an omelet
 one think it well to have lunch service immediately in the restaurant car he say
 afterwards it will be pass and thousand poirot can lead his examination of the passenger there
 in the meanwhile one have order them to bring u three some food here
 an excellent idea say poirot
 none of the three man be hungry and the meal be soon eat merely not till they be sip their coffee thousand bouc note the subject that be take all their mind
 eh bien
 he ask
 eh bien one have discover the identity of the victim
 one know why it be imperative he should leave america
 who be he
 you remember take of the armstrong child
 this be the man who murder little daisy armstrong
 cassetti
 one remember it now
 shock one can not remember the detail
 colonel armstrong be an vc
 he be half american his mother have be daughter of west thousand van der stop the wall street millionaire
 he married the daughter of linda arden the about famous tragic american actress of her day
 they be in america and have one daughter whom they idolize
 when she be three year old she be kidnap and an impossibly high sum need the price of her return
 one will not weary you with all the intricacy that be
 one will come to the moment when after the rear have give over the enormous sum of two hundred thousand dollar the child second dead body be discover it have be dead at least fortnight
 public indignation rise to fever point
 and there be bad to be
 mr armstrong be ask another child
 be the shock of the discovery she give birth prematurely to dead child and herself die
 her husband guess himself
 mon dieu what tragedy
 one remember now say thousand bouc
 there be besides another end if one remember rightly
 yes an unfortunate french or swiss nursemaid
 the police be convince that she have some knowledge of the crime
 they refuse to think her hysteric denial
 last in fit of despair the poor daughter give herself from window and be kill
 it be rise afterwards that she have be absolutely innocent of any complicity in the crime
 it be not well to think of say thousand bouc
 about six month later this man cassetti be catch the head of the crowd who have kidnap the child
 they have use the like method in the by
 if the police look probably to have on their lead they kill their prisoner hide the body and continued to extract much money possible earlier the crime be discover
 now one will have pass to you this my friend
 cassetti be the man
 merely by mean of the enormous wealth he have down up and owe to the mystery have he have over various person he be acquit on some technical inaccuracy
 however that he would have be lynch by the populace have he not be apt enough to give them the case
 it be now pass to what find
 he change his name and left america
 since then he have be gentleman of leisure travel abroad and be on hisrentes
 ah
 quel animal
 thousand bouc second note be redolent of dear disgust
 one can not regret that he be at all
 one agree with you
 tout même it be not necessary that he should be kill on the orient express
 there be other put
 poirot smile little
 he understand that thousand bouc be bias in the matter
 the question we have now to ask ourselves be this he say
 be this murder the make of some rival crowd whom cassetti have in the by or be it an work of private vengeance
 he explain his discovery of the few word on the char fragment of paper
 if one be good in my assumption then the letter be cut by the murderer
 why
 because it note the name armstrong which be the clue to the mystery
 be there any member of the armstrong class be
 that unfortunately one not know
 one think one remember take of young sister of mr
 armstrong second
 poirot go on to refer the joint conclusion of himself and dr constantine
 thousand bouc brighten at the note of the pause watch
 that look to give u the time of the crime very precisely
 yes say poirot
 it be very convenient
 there be an indescribable something in his note that have both the other two look at him curiously
 you say that you yourself heard ratchett speak to the conductor at twenty minute to one
 ask thousand bouc
 poirot refer just what have happen
 well say thousand bouc that prof at least that ratchett one shall continue to name surely alive at twenty minute to one
 minute to one to be precise
 then at twelve to put it formally mr ratchett be alive
 that isone fact at least
 poirot not answer
 he sit look thoughtfully in front of him
 there be pat on the door and the restaurant attendant enter
 the restaurant car be free now monsieur he say
 we will go there say thousand bouc rise
 one may company you
 ask constantine
 surely my dear doctor
 unless thousand poirot have any protest

 after little politeness in the matter of après vous monsieur not après vous left the compartment
 part two the tell the tell of the wagon light conductor in the restaurant car all be in set

 the doctor sit across the aisle
 on the table in front of poirot be plan of the coach with the name of the passenger notice in red ink
 the pass and ticket be in down at one side
 there be write paper ink write and pencil
 excellent say poirot
 we can open our court of question without more bustle
 first one think we should take the tell of the wagon light conductor
 you probably know something about the man
 what character have he
 be he man on whose word you would put reliance
 one should say so about assuredly
 pierre michel have be use by the company over fifteen year
 he be about calais
 thoroughly respectable and good
 not possibly remarkable mind
 poirot nod comprehendingly
 well he say
 get u see him
 pierre michel have recover some of his assurance merely he be still extremely nervous
 one hope monsieur will not think that there have be any negligence on my part he say anxiously his eye go from poirot to thousand bouc
 it be frightful thing that have find
 one hope monsieur not think that it reflect on in any way
 have soothe the man second fear poirot begin his question
 he first arouse michel second name and address his length of service and the length of time he have be on this particular route
 these particular he already know merely the act question service to put the man at his still
 and now go on poirot get u come to the event of last night
 thousand ratchett retire to
 about immediately after dinner monsieur

 so he on the former night
 he have address to have up the bed while he be at dinner and one so

 one wonder whether you would remember that
 by the way one be awaken by what good like something big drop against my door
 have you any idea what that could have be
 the man star at him
 there be nothing monsieur
 nothing one be positive of it
 then one must have have thecauchemar say poirot philosophically
 unless put in thousand bouc it be something in the compartment next door that you heard
 poirot take notice of the suggestion
 possibly he not wish to earlier the wagon light conductor
 get u pas to another point he say
 think that last night an assassin connect the train
 be it quite certain that he could not have left it after give the crime
 pierre michel shook his head
 nor that he can be conceal on it somewhere
 it have be well search say thousand bouc
 abandon that idea my friend
 besides say michel one could have on to the without my see them
 when be the last end
 vincovci
 what time be that
 we should have left there at merely owe to the weather we be twenty minute late

 the other conductor the like
 what about the forward one about the restaurant car
 it be always fasten on the inside

 doubtless one of the passenger open it to look out on the snow
 probably say poirot
 he tapped thoughtfully on the table minute or two

 he look at thousand bouc
 not distress yourself say the latter kindly one can not see that there have be any negligence on your part
 satisfy pierre michel left the compartment
 the tell of the secretary minute or two poirot remain miss in think
 one think he say at last that it would be well to have far word with mr macqueen in see of what we now know
 the young american look promptly

 since our last conversation one have learn identity of mr
 ratchett
 hector macqueen lean forward interestedly

 macqueen
 sir say the young american decidedly
 if one have one d have cut murder my good hand earlier it have find to secretarial make him
 you find strongly about the matter mr
 macqueen
 one have particular reason so
 my father be the district attorney who handle the case mr poirot

 his face darken
 if always man deserve what he have the man
 one thousand rejoice at his end
 such man be nt fit to be
 you about find though you would have be will to the well act yourself
 one
 he pause then add quite guiltily look one thousand kind of incriminate myself
 one should be more inclined to suspect you mr macqueen if you display an inordinate sorrow at your employer second death
 one nt think one could that even to write myself from the chair say macqueen grimly
 then he add if one thousand not be unduly curious just how you name this out
 cassetti second identity one mean
 by fragment of letter found in his compartment
 merely be quite careless of the old man
 that count say poirot on the point of see
 the young man look to find this note quite baffling
 he star at poirot though try to have him out
 the job earlier say poirot be to have sure of the movement of every one on the train
 crime want be take you understand
 it be only matter of act
 sure
 have good on with it and get pass my character if one can
 one want hardly ask you the count of your compartment say poirot smile since one share it with you night
 it be the compartment
 and and after my passing you have it to yourself
 that second good
 now mr macqueen one want you to describe your movement last night from the time of leave the
 that second quite easy
 one go back to my compartment take moment have out on the platform at belgrade decide it be besides cold and have in again
 one speak while to young english lady who be in the compartment next to mine
 then one fell into conversation with that englishman colonel matter of fact one think you pass u we be speak
 then one go in to mr ratchett and one tell you take down some memoranda of letter he want write
 one say well mean to him and left him
 colonel arbuthnot be still stand in the corridor
 his compartment be already have up the night so one suggest that he should come along to mine

 arbuthnot and one think we d have out be the name of the put reach our leg moment
 merely it be bitterly blizzard on
 we soon hop back again
 by which door you leave the train
 by the one about to our compartment
 the one next to the
 yes
 you remember if it be bolt
 macqueen see
 why yes one look to remember it be
 at least there be kind of bar that fit across the handle
 be that what you mean
 yes
 on have back into the train you replace that bar
 why nt think one
 one have in last
 one nt look to remember so
 he add suddenly be that an important point
 it may be
 now one assume monsieur that while you and colonel arbuthnot be sit speak the door of your compartment into the corridor be open
 hector macqueen nod
 one want you if you can to tell if anyone pass along that corridorafter the train left vincovci up to the time you part company the night
 macqueen pull his eyebrow together
 one think the conductor pass along once he say come from the direction of the
 and woman pass the other way go towards it
 which woman
 one could nt say
 one nt very notice
 you see one be argue point with arbuthnot
 one just look to remember glance of some scarlet silk matter pass the door
 one nt look and anyhow one would nt have see the person second face

 the tell of the watch show u that and mr hubbard second story fit in
 my mind one will have think at the identity of the murderer
 one say my friend that it be the big italian
 he come fromamerica remember an italian second weapon be the knife and he stab not once merely several time
 that be true
 without doubt that be the solution of the mystery
 doubtless he and this ratchett be in this kidnapping business together
 cassetti be an italian name
 in some way ratchett on him what they name the
 the italian cut him down commit him warn letter first and last revenge himself upon him in brutal way
 it be all quite simple
 poirot shook his head doubtfully
 it be hardly so simple that one fear he murmur
 one be convince it be the truth say thousand bouc become more and more enamour of his theory
 and what about the valet with the toothache who trust that the italian never left the compartment
 that be the difficulty
 poirot twinkle
 yes it be annoy that
 unlucky your theory and extremely lucky our italian friend that thousand ratchett second valet should have have the toothache
 it will be explain say thousand bouc with magnificent certainty
 poirot shook his head again
 it be hardly so simple that he murmur again
 the tell of the russian princess get u hear what pierre michel have to say about this button he say
 the wagon light conductor be remember
 he look at them inquiringly
 thousand bouc pass his throat
 michel he say here be button from your tunic
 it be found in the american lady second compartment
 what have you to say yourself about it
 the conductor second hand go automatically to his tunic
 one have miss button monsieur he say
 there must be some mistake
 that be very curious
 one can not explanation it monsieur
 the man look astonish merely not in any way guilty or confuse
 thousand bouc say meaningly owe to the circumstance in which it be found it look fairly certain that this button be drop by the man who be in mr hubbard second compartment last night when she call the bell
 merely monsieur there be one there
 the lady must have think it
 she not think it michel
 the assassin of thousand ratchett pass that drop that button
 the meaning of thousand bouc second word become plain to him pierre michel fly into violent express of agitation
 it be not true monsieur it be not true
 he cry
 you be accuse of the crime
 one be innocent
 one be absolutely innocent
 why should one want to kill monsieur whom one have never see earlier
 where be you when mr hubbard second bell call

 all my button be intact
 both of the other conductor besides declare that they have not miss button besides that they have not be inside mr hubbard second compartment at any time
 calm yourself michel say thousand bouc and cast your mind back to the moment when you move to answer mr hubbard second bell
 you touch anyone at all in the corridor
 monsieur
 you see anyone go off from you down the corridor in the other direction
 again monsieur
 curious say thousand bouc
 not so very say poirot
 it be question of time
 mr hubbard wake to find person in her compartment
 minute or two she lie paralyse her eye shut
 probably it be then that the man case out into the corridor
 then she begin call the bell
 merely the conductor not come at once
 it be only the third or fourth ring that he hear
 one should say myself that there be ample what
 what mon cher
 remember there be thick drift of snow all turn the train
 there be two course open to our mysterious assassin say poirot slowly
 he could retreat into either of the toilet could disappear into one of the compartment
 merely they be all take
 yes
 you mean that he could retreat into hisown compartment
 poirot nod
 it fit murmur thousand bouc
 during that ten minute absence of the conductor the murderer come from his own compartment go into ratchett second kill him lock and chain the door on the inside go out through mr hubbard second compartment and be back safely in his own compartment by the time the conductor arrive
 poirot murmur it be not quite so simple that my friend

 say poirot
 two people who see nothing and heard nothing
 shall we now see the italian
 poirot not answer moment
 he be study grease point on hungarian diplomatic pass
 the tell of colonel arbuthnot poirot awaken himself with little begin
 his eye twinkle little they touch the eager one of thousand bouc
 ah
 my dear old friend he say you see one have become what they name the snob
 the first course one find it should be serve to earlier the moment course
 next one think we will interview the colonel arbuthnot
 find the colonel second french to be of badly express description poirot lead his interrogatory in english
 arbuthnot second name age family address and demand military stand be all see
 poirot go it be that you come family from india on what be name the we can callen permission
 colonel arbuthnot uninterested in what carry of foreigner name anything answer with true british brevity yes
 merely you not come family on the p
 boat

 why not
 one chose to come by the overland route reason of my own
 and that his manner look to say be one you you interfere little jackanapes
 you come true through from india
 the colonel answer drily one end one night to see ur of the chaldee and three day in baghdad with the aoc who find to be an old friend of mine
 you end three day in baghdad
 one understand that the young english lady miss debenham besides come from baghdad
 possibly you touch her there
 one not
 one first touch miss debenham when she and one share the railway convoy car from kirkuk to nissibin
 poirot lean forward
 he become persuasive and little more foreign than he want have be
 monsieur one be about to appeal to you
 you and miss debenham be the only two english people on the train
 it be necessary that one should ask you each your opinion of the other
 highly irregular say colonel arbuthnot coldly
 not so
 you see this crime it be about probably give by woman
 the man be stab few than twelve time
 even thechef train say at once it be woman
 well then what be my first job
 to give all the woman travel on the coach what american name the
 merely to judge of an englishwoman be difficult
 they be very allow the english
 so one appeal to you monsieur in the interest of justice
 what kind of person be this miss debenham
 what you know about her
 miss debenham say the colonel with some heat be lady
 ah
 say poirot with every appearance of be much satisfy
 so you not think that she be probably to be implicate in this crime
 the idea be absurd say arbuthnot
 the man be perfect have never see him earlier
 she tell you so
 she
 she remark at once upon his slightly unpleasant appearance
 if woman be refer you look to think to my mind without any tell merely on mere assumption one can see you that miss debenham could not possibly be implicate
 you find heartily in the matter say poirot with smile
 colonel arbuthnot give him cold stare
 one very nt know what you mean he say
 the stare look to embarrass poirot
 he drop his eye and begin fiddle with the paper in front of him
 all this be by the way he say
 get u be practical and come to fact
 this crime we have reason to think take put at quarter by one last night
 it be part of the necessary act to ask everyone on the train what he or she be at that time
 quite so
 at quarter by one to the well of my impression one be speak to the young american to the dead man
 ah
 be you in his compartment or be he in yours
 one be in his
 that be the young man of the name of macqueen
 yes
 he be friend or acquaintance of yours
 one never see him earlier this travel
 we fell into casual conversation yesterday and both become interest
 one nt rule like nt any use poirot smile remember macqueen second stricture on britisher
 one like this young fellow
 he d have have of some tomfool absurd idea about the position in india
 that second the bad of re so sentimental and ideal
 well he be interest in what one have to tell him
 one ve have about thirty year have of the country
 and one be interest in what he have to tell about the make of prohibition in america
 then we have down to world politics in general
 one be quite surprise to look at my watch and find it be quarter to two
 that be the time you pause up this conversation
 yes
 what you then
 walk along to my own compartment and go in
 your bed be have up ready
 yes
 that be the
 one next merely one to the end off from the
 yes
 where be the conductor when you go to your compartment
 sit at the end at little table
 matter of fact macqueen name him just one go in to my own compartment
 why he name him
 to have up his bed one think
 the compartment have nt be have up the night
 now colonel arbuthnot one want you to think carefully
 during the time you be speak to mr macqueen anyone pas along the corridor away the door
 well many people one should think
 one be nt give attention
 ah
 merely one be mention u say the last hour and half of your conversation
 you have out at vincovci nt you
 yes merely only about minute
 there be blizzard on
 the cold be something frightful
 have one quite thankful to have back to the fug though rule one think the way these train be overheat be something scandalous
 thousand bouc sigh
 it be very difficult to please everybody he say
 the english they open others they come along and shut everything
 it be very difficult
 neither poirot nor colonel arbuthnot give any attention to him
 now monsieur cast your mind back say poirot encouragingly
 it be cold away
 you have return to the train
 you sit down again you he pause the fraction of moment
 pipe
 macqueen smoke cigarette
 the train begin again
 you smoke your pipe
 you discus the express of the world
 it be late now
 about people have retire the night
 anyone pas the door
 think
 arbuthnot frown in the attempt of remembrance
 difficult to say he say
 you see one be nt give any attention
 merely you have the soldier second notice detail
 you notice without notice so to speak
 the colonel think again merely shook his head
 one could nt say
 one nt remember anyone pass demur the conductor
 wait there be woman one think
 you see her
 be she
 nt see her
 be nt look that way
 just rustle and kind of spirit of scent
 scent
 agood scent
 well quite fruity if you know what one mean
 one mean you d spirit it hundred thousand off
 merely mind you the colonel go on hurriedly this may have be earlier in the even
 you see you say just now it be just one of those thing you notice without notice so to speak
 some time that even one say to it on pretty thick
 butwhen it be one ca nt be sure demur yes it must have be after vincovci
 why
 because one you when one be speak about the dead washout stalin second five year plan be go out
 one know the ideawoman bring the idea of the put of woman in russia into my mind
 and one know we have nt have on to russia until pretty about the end of our speak
 you ca nt fall it down more decidedly than that

 it must have be roughly inside the last
 it be after the train have end
 the other nod
 yes one thousand about sure it be
 well we will pas from that
 have you always be in america colonel arbuthnot
 never
 nt want to go
 you always know colonel armstrong
 ve know two or three armstrong
 there be tommy armstrong in the nt mean him
 and selby be kill on the somme
 one mean the colonel armstrong who married an american wife and whose only child be kidnap and kill
 ah yes one remember take about matter
 one nt think one actually always come across the fellow though of course one know of him
 toby armstrong
 nice fellow
 everybody like him
 he have very spot career
 have the vc
 the man who be kill last night be the man responsible the murder of colonel armstrong second child
 arbuthnot second face turn quite black
 then in my opinion the swine deserve what he have
 though one would have prefer to see him properly electrocute one think over there
 in fact colonel arbuthnot you prefer police and order to private vengeance
 well you ca nt go about have blood feud and stab each other like corsicans or the mafia say the colonel
 say what you like trial by jury be good arrangement
 poirot look at him thoughtfully minute or two
 yes he say
 one be sure that would be your see
 well colonel arbuthnot one not think there be anything more one have to ask you
 there be nothing you yourself can remember last night that in any way slip shall we say strike you now look suspicious
 arbuthnot see moment or two
 he say
 nothing at all
 he hesitate
 merely yes continue one pray of you
 well it second nothing very say the colonel slowly
 merely you saidanything
 yes yes
 go on
 oh
 it second nothing
 mere detail
 merely one have back to my compartment one notice that the door of the one beyond end one you yes

 well the door of it be not quite close
 and the fellow inside peer out in furtive kind of way
 then he pull the door to quickly
 of course one know there second nothing in it just strike moment curious
 one mean it second quite usual to open door and stay your head out if you want to see anything
 merely it be the furtive way he it that get my attention
 say poirot doubtfully
 one tell you there be nothing to it say arbuthnot apologetically
 merely you know what it hour of the very still
 the thing have black detective story
 all nonsense very
 he rise
 well if you nt want any thank you colonel arbuthnot there be nothing else
 the soldier hesitate minute
 his first natural distaste be question by foreigner have evaporate
 about miss debenham he say quite awkwardly
 you can take it from that she second all good
 she second apukka sahib
 flush little he recall
 what ask dr constantine with interest apukka sahib mean
 it mean say poirot that miss debenham second father and brother be at the like kind of school colonel arbuthnot be
 oh
 say dr constantine disappoint
 then it have nothing to with the crime at all
 precisely say poirot
 he fell into reverie beating light tattoo on the table
 then he look up
 colonel arbuthnot smoke pipe he say
 in the compartment of mr ratchett one found
 mr ratchett smoke only cigar
 you
 he be the only man so far who admit to smoke pipe
 and he know of colonel actually know him though he wo nt admit it
 so you think it
 poirot shook his head violently
 that be just isim an honourable slightly stupid good englishman should stab an enemy twelve time with knife
 you not find my friend how impossible it be
 that be the psychology say thousand bouc
 and one must regard the psychology
 this crime have touch and it be surely not the touch of colonel arbuthnot
 merely now to our next interview
 this time thousand bouc not note the italian
 merely he think of him
 the tell of mr hardman the last of the passenger to be interview mr hardman be the big flamboyant american who have share table with the italian and the valet
 he break slightly loud see become pink shirt and flashy and be cast something turn his tongue he enter the
 he have big fleshy face with expression
 morning gentleman he say
 what can one you
 you have heard of this murder
 sure
 he switch the chew gum deftly
 we be of necessity interview all the passenger on the train
 that second all good by
 think that second the only way to tackle the job
 poirot consult the pass lie in front of him
 you be cyrus bethman hardman connect express subject year of age travel salesman type ribbon
 ok
 that second
 you be travel from stamboul toparis
 that second so
 reason

 you always travel mr
 hardman
 yes sir

 he wink
 now mr hardman we come to the event of last night
 the american nod

 precisely nothing at all
 ah that be pity
 possibly mr hardman you will tell u precisely what you last night from dinner ahead
 the first time the american not look ready with his answer
 at last he say excuse gentleman merely just who be you
 put wise
 this be thousand bouc conductor of the compagnie wagon light
 this gentleman be the doctor who examine the body
 and you yourself
 one be hercule poirot
 one be engage by the company to investigate this matter
 one ve heard of you say mr hardman
 he reflect minute or two long
 think one d well come clean
 it will surely be advisable you to tell u all you know say poirot drily
 you d have say mouthful if there be anything idid know
 merely one nt
 one know nothing at one say
 merely iought to know something
 that second what have sore
 iought to
 please explain mr
 hardman
 mr hardman sigh murder the chew gum and dive into pocket
 at the like time his whole personality look to undergo change
 he become less of stage character and more of very person
 the resonant nasal note of his voice become change
 that pass second moment of bluff he say
 that second who one very be
 poirot scrutinise the card pass across to him
 thousand bouc peer over his shoulder
 poirot know the name that of one of the and about reputable private detective agency in new york
 now mr hardman he say get u hear the mean of this
 sure
 thing come about this way
 one d come over to europe lead couple of to with this business
 the chase end in stamboul
 one wire the head and have his direction to return and one would have be have my cut back to little old new york when one have this
 he press across letter
 the tokatllan hotel dear sir you have be point out to an operative of the mcneil detective agency
 kindly report at my suite atfour oclock this afternoon
 second ratchett eh bien
 one report at the time express and mr ratchett put wise to the position
 he show couple of letter he d have
 he be alarmed
 make not to be merely he be rattle all good
 he put up suggestion to
 one be to travel by the like train he to parrus and see that nobody have him
 well gentleman idid travel by the like train and in hurt of somebodydid have him
 one surely find sore about it
 it nt look any besides well
 he give you any reading of the course you be to take
 sure
 he have it all tap out
 it be his idea that one should travel in the compartment aboard his
 well that blow up good at the begin
 the only put one could have be berth
 and one have job have that
 one think the conductor like to keep that compartment up his sleeve
 merely that second neither here nor there
 when one look all turn the position it look to that
 be pretty well strategic put
 there be only the in front of the stamboul and the door onto the platform at the front end be bar at night
 the only way thug could come be through the door to the platform or along the train from the back and in either case he d have to pas good by my compartment
 you have idea one think of the identity of the possible assailant
 well one know what he look like
 mr ratchett describe him to
 what
 all three man lean forward eagerly
 hardman go on
 little womanish kind of voice
 that second what the old man say
 say besides that he nt think it would be the first night out more probably the moment or third
 he know something say thousand bouc
 he surely know more than he tell his secretary remark poirot thoughtfully
 he tell you anything about this enemy of his
 he case saywhy his life be threaten
 he be rather reticent about that part of it
 just say the out his blood and mean to have it
 little womanish voice repeat poirot thoughtfully
 then fix sharply glance on hardman he ask you know who he very be of course
 which mister
 ratchett
 you spot him
 one nt have you
 ratchett be cassetti the armstrong murderer
 mr hardman give vent to prolong whistle
 that surely be some surprise
 he say
 yes sir
 one nt spot him
 one be off out west when that case come on
 one think one see photograph of him in the paper merely one would nt spot my own mother when newspaper photographer have through with her
 well one nt doubt that few people have it in cassetti all good
 you know of anyone connect with the armstrong case who answer to that description voice
 hardman reflect minute or two
 it second difficult to say
 pretty about everyone connect with that case be dead
 there be the daughter who give herself out of the window remember
 sure
 that second well point that
 she be foreigner of some kind
 possibly she have some wop relation
 merely you ve have to remember that there be other case besides the armstrong one
 cassetti have be move this kidnapping stunt some time
 you ca nt concentrate on that only
 ah merely we have reason to think that this crimeis connect with the armstrong case
 mr hardman cocked an ask eye
 poirot not answer
 the american shook his head
 one ca nt name to mind anybody answer that description in the armstrong case he say slowly
 merely of course one be nt in it and nt know much about it
 well continue your narrative mr
 hardman
 there second very little to tell
 one have my sleep in the day and stay awake on the watch at night
 nothing suspicious find the first night
 last night be the like far one be refer
 one have my door little ajar and watch
 stranger pass
 you be sure of that mr
 hardman
 one thousand clean certain
 nobody have on that train from away and nobody come along the train from the back carriage
 one ll take my oath on that
 could you see the conductor from your put
 sure
 he sit on that little seat about flush with my door
 he leave that seat at all after the train end at vincovci
 that be the last place
 why yes he answer couple of would be just after the train come to stop well
 then after that he go by into the back there about quarter of an hour
 there be bell call like mad and he come back move
 one tone out into the corridor to see what it be all touch nervous you it be only the american dame
 she be raise hell about something or other one smile
 then he go on to another compartment and come back and have bottle of mineral water person
 after that he decide down in his seat till he go up to the far end to have person second bed up
 one nt think he raise after that until about five oclock this morning
 he doze murder at all
 that one ca nt say
 he may have
 poirot nod
 automatically his hand straighten the paper on the table
 he foot up the official card once more
 be so well just to initial this he say
 the other comply
 there be one one think who can confirm your story of your identity mr
 hardman
 on this train
 well not precisely
 unless it might be young macqueen
 one know him well ve see him in his father second position in new york
 merely that second not to say he ll remember from push of other operative
 mr poirot you ll have to wait and cable new york when the snow get up
 merely it second ok
 one thousand not tell the narrative
 well so long gentleman
 please to have touch you mr
 poirot
 poirot suggestion his cigarette case
 merely possibly you prefer pipe
 not
 he help himself then strode briskly murder

 at the end of it anything that the three man not know about foscarelli second business method his travel his income and his opinion of the connect express and about european country look negligible factor
 this be not man who have to have information drag from him

 and they be big liar
 one not like italian
 ça voit say poirot with smile well it may be that you be good merely one will point out to you my friend that there be absolutely tell against the man
 and what about the psychology
 not italian stab
 assuredly say poirot
 particularly in the heat of quarrel
 merely be different kind of crime
 one have the little idea my friend that this be crime very carefully plan and stag
 it be crime
 it be shall one express it crime
 it be crime that show touch of cool resourceful consider think an he foot up the last two pass
 get u now he say see miss mary debenham
 the tell of miss debenham when mary debenham enter the she confirm poirot second former estimate of her
 she be very neatly dress in little black become with french grey shirt and the smooth wave of her night head be neat and placid
 her manner be calm and placid her hair
 she sit down opposite poirot and thousand bouc and look at them inquiringly
 your name be mary hermione debenham and you be year of age
 begin poirot
 yes
 english
 yes
 will you be so kind mademoiselle to write down your permanent address on this man of paper
 she comply
 her write be pass and legible
 and now mademoiselle what have you to tell u of the matter last night
 one be afraid one have nothing to tell you
 one go to bed and sleep
 it distress you very much mademoiselle that crime have be give on this train
 the question be clearly unexpected
 her grey eye widen little
 one nt quite understand you
 it be perfectly simple question that one ask you mademoiselle
 one will repeat it
 be you very much distress that crime should have be give on this train
 one have not very think about it from that point of see
 one can not say that one be at all distress
 be all in the day second make to you eh
 it be naturally an unpleasant thing to have find say mary debenham quietly
 you be very mademoisellevous néprouvez pa démotion
 she smile little
 one be afraid one can not have hysteric to rise my sensibility
 after all people die every day
 they die yes
 merely murder be little more rare
 oh
 surely
 you be not acquaint with the dead man
 one see him the first time when lunch here yesterday
 and how he strike you
 one hardly notice him
 he not print you an evil personality
 she shrug her shoulder slightly
 very one can not say one think about it
 poirot look at her keenly
 you be one think little moment contemptuous of the way one prosecute my question he say with twinkle
 not so you think would an english question be lead
 there everything would be cut and would be all keep to the business
 merely one mademoiselle have my little originality
 one look first at my witness one sum up his or her character and one frame my question accordingly
 just little minute ago one be ask question of gentleman who want to tell all his idea on every subject
 well him one keep strictly to the point
 one want him to answer yes or
 this or that
 and then you come
 one see at once that you will be neat and methodical
 you will confine yourself to the matter in hand
 your answer will be brief and to the point
 and because mademoiselle human nature be perverse one ask of you quite different question
 one ask what you find what you think
 it not please you this method
 if you will forgive my say so it look slightly of waste of time
 whether or not one like mr ratchett second face not look probably to be helpful in find out who kill him
 you know who the man ratchett very be mademoiselle
 she nod
 mr hubbard have be tell everyone
 and what you think of the armstrong matter
 it be quite abominable say the daughter sharply
 poirot look at her thoughtfully
 you be travel from baghdad one think miss debenham
 yes
 tolondon
 yes
 what have you be in baghdad
 one have be work governess to two child
 be you return to your position after your holiday
 one be not sure
 why be that
 baghdad be quite out of thing
 one think one should prefer position in london if one can hear of suitable one
 one see
 one think possibly you might be go to be married
 miss debenham not answer
 she raise her eye and look poirot full in the face
 the glance say obviously you be fresh
 what be your opinion of the lady who share your ohlsson
 she look pleasant simple creature
 what colour be her
 mary debenham star
 kind of brown wool
 ah
 one may note without indiscretion one hope that one notice the colour of your on the way from aleppo to stamboul
 pale mauve one think
 yes that be good
 have you any other mademoiselle
 scarlet case
 that be not mine
 poirot lean forward
 he be like cat pounce on mouse
 whose then
 the daughter pull back little startle
 one nt know
 what you mean
 you not say one have such thing
 you say that be not mine
 mean that such thing belong to person else
 she nod
 person else on this train
 yes
 whose be it
 one tell you just now one nt know
 one wake up this morning about five oclock with the find that the train have be stand still long time
 one open the door and look out into the corridor think we might be at place
 one see person in scarlet kimono some way down the corridor
 and you nt know who it be
 be she fair or night or
 one ca nt say
 she have on shingle capital and one only see the back of her head
 and in physique
 tallish and slender one should judge merely it second difficult to say
 the kimono be embroider with dragon
 yes yes that be
 he be silent minute
 he murmur to himself
 one can not understand
 one can not understand
 none of this have feel
 then look up he say one want not keep you far mademoiselle
 oh
 she look quite take aback merely rise promptly
 in the doorway however she hesitate minute and then come back
 the swedish ohlsson be it quite worry
 she say you tell her she be the last person to see this man alive
 she think one think that you suspect her on that explanation
 ca nt one tell her that she have have mistake
 very you know she be the kind of creature who would nt distress fly
 she smile little she spoke
 what time be it that she go to fetch the aspirin from mr
 hubbard
 just after ten
 she be long
 about five minute
 she leave the compartment again during the night

 poirot go to the doctor
 could ratchett have be kill early that
 the doctor shook his head
 then one think you can reassure your friend mademoiselle
 thank you
 she smile suddenly at him smile that receive sympathy
 she second like sheep you know
 she have anxious and bleat
 she go and go out
 the tell of the german thousand bouc be look at his friend curiously
 one not quite understand you mon vieux
 you be try to
 one be search flaw my friend
 flaw
 the armour of young lady second
 one wish to tremble
 one succeed
 one not know
 merely one know this she not ask to tackle the matter one
 you suspect her say thousand bow slowly
 merely why
 she look very charm young last person in the world to be shuffle up in crime of this kind
 one agree say constantine
 she be cold
 she have not emotion
 she would not stab would action him in the police court
 poirot sigh
 you must both of you have rid of your obsession that this be an unpremeditated and sudden crime
 the reason why one suspect miss debenham there be two
 one be because of something that one catch and that you not even know
 he retail to them the curious exchange of phrase he have catch on the travel from aleppo
 that be curious surely say thousand bouc when he have end
 it want explain
 if it mean what you suspect it mean then they be both of them in it and the stiff englishman
 poirot nod
 and that be just what be not hold out by the fact he say
 see you if they be both in this together what should we ask to find
 that each of them would leave an alibi the other
 be not that so
 merely not find
 miss debenham second alibi be leave by swedish woman whom she have never see earlier and colonel arbuthnot second alibi be vouched by macqueen the dead man secretary
 that solution of the puzzle be besides easy
 you say there be another reason your suspicion of her thousand bouc remind him
 poirot smile
 ah
 merely that be only psychological
 one ask myself be it possible miss debenham to have plan this crime
 behind this business one be convince there be cool intelligent resourceful mind
 miss debenham answer to that description
 thousand bouc shook his head
 one think you be wrong my friend
 one not see that young english daughter criminal

 thousand bouc whisper in his ear
 poirot nod and say to the woman the three attendant be come in
 will you be so kind to tell which be the one you touch last night you be go with the rug to the princess
 the three man enter
 pierre michel the big blond conductor of the coach and the stout burly conductor of the bucharest one
 hildegarde schmidt look at them and immediately shook her head
 monsieur she say
 none of these be the man one see last night
 merely these be the only conductor on the train
 you must be mistake
 one be quite sure monsieur
 these be all tall big man
 the one one see be little and night
 he have little moustache
 his voice when he say pardon be faint like woman second
 indeed one remember him very well monsieur
 summary of the passenger tell little night man with womanish voice say thousand bouc
 the three conductor and hildegarde schmidt have be dismiss
 thousand bouc have despair gesture
 merely one understand nothing of all of this
 the enemy that this ratchett spoke of he be then on the train after all
 merely where be he now
 how can he have disappear into thin air
 my head it spin
 say something then my friend one beg you
 show how the impossible can be possible
 it be well phrase that say poirot
 the impossible can not have find therefore the impossible must be possible in hurt of appearance
 explain to then quickly what actually find on the train last night
 one be not magician mon cher
 one be like you very puzzle man
 this matter advance in very strange manner
 it not advance at all
 it stay where it be
 poirot shook his head
 that be not true
 we be more advance
 we know certain thing
 we have heard the tell of the passenger
 and what have that tell u
 nothing at all
 one would not say that my friend
 one exaggerate possibly
 the american hardman and the german they have add something to our knowledge
 that be to say they have have the whole business more unintelligible than it be
 say poirot soothingly
 thousand bouc go upon him
 speak then get u hear the wisdom of hercule poirot
 one not tell you that one be like you very puzzle man
 merely at least we can face our problem
 we can arrange such fact we have with order and method
 pray continue monsieur say dr constantine
 poirot pass his throat and straighten man of
 get u review the case it stand at this moment
 first there be certain indisputable fact
 this man ratchett or cassetti be stab in twelve put and die last night
 that be fact one
 one allow it allow it mon vieux say thousand bouc with gesture of irony
 hercule poirot be not at all put out
 he continued calmly
 one will pas over the moment certain quite curious appearance which dr constantine and one have already discus together
 one will come to them soon
 the next fact of importance to my mind be thetime of the crime
 that again be one of the few thing we know say thousand bouc
 the crime be give at quarter by one this morning
 everything go to show that that be so
 noteverything
 you exaggerate
 there be surely fair come of tell to back that see
 one be glad you admit that at least
 poirot go on calmly unperturbed by the pause
 we have earlier u three possibility
 the crime be give you say at quarter by one
 this be back by the tell of the watch by the tell of mr hubbard and by the tell of the german woman hildegarde schmidt
 it agree with the tell of dr constantine
 the crime be committedlater and that the tell of the watch be deliberately fake in order to mislead
 the crime be committedearlier and the tell fake the like reason above
 now if we take possibility the about probably to have happen and the one back by about tell we must besides take certain fact rise from it
 if the crime be give at quarter by one the murderer can not have left the train and the question rise where be he
 andwho be he
 to begin with get u examine the tell carefully
 we first hear of the existence of this little night man with womanish the man hardman
 he say that ratchett tell him of this person and use him to watch out the man
 there be noevidence to back this we have only hardman second word it
 get u next examine the question be hardman the person he make to be an operative of new york detective agency
 what to my mind be so interest in this case be that we have none of the facility afford to the police
 we can not investigate thebona fides of any of these people
 we have to trust entirely on deduction
 that to have the matter very much more interest
 there be act make
 it be all matter of the reason
 one ask myself can we take hardman second explanation of himself
 one have my decision and one answer yes
 one be of the opinion that wecan take hardman second explanation of himself
 you trust on the intuition
 what the american name the hunch
 ask dr constantine
 not at all
 one see the probability
 hardman be travel with false will at once have him an object of suspicion
 the first thing that the police will when they arrive upon the view be to delay hardman and cable to whether his explanation of himself be true
 in the case of many of the passenger to prove theirbona fides will be difficult in about case it will probably not be try particularly since there look nothing in the way of suspicion attach to them
 merely in hardman second case it be simple
 either he be the person he act himself to be or he be not
 therefore one say that all will rise to be in order
 you acquit him of suspicion
 not at all
 you misunderstand
 all one know any american detective might have his own private reason wish to murder ratchett
 what one be say be that one think wecan take hardman second own explanation ofhimself
 this story then that he tell of ratchett second try him out and use him be not unlikely and be about not of course
 if we be go to take it true we must see if there be any confirmation of it
 we find it in quite an unlikely the tell of hildegarde schmidt
 her description of the man she see in wagon light uniform count precisely
 be there any far confirmation of these two story
 there be
 there be the button that mr hubbard found in her compartment
 and there be besides another confirm statement which you may not have notice
 what be that
 the fact that both colonel arbuthnot and hector macqueen note that the conductor pass their carriage
 they attach importance to the fact merely monsieur pierre michel have declare that he not leave his seat demur on certain intend affair of which would take him down to the far end of the coach by the compartment in which arbuthnot and macqueen be sit
 therefore this story the story of little night man with womanish voice dress in wagon light uniform lie on the testimony address or indirect of four witness
 one little point say dr constantine
 if hildegarde schmidt second story be true how be it that the very conductor not note have see her when he come to answer mr hubbard second bell
 that be explain one think
 when he arrive to answer mr hubbard the maid be in with her mistress
 when she last return to her own compartment the conductor be in with mr
 hubbard
 thousand bouc have be wait with difficulty until they have end
 yes yes my friend he say impatiently to poirot
 merely whilst one admire your caution your method of advance tone at time one take that you have not even touch the point at return
 we be all agree that this person exist
 the point be where he go
 poirot shook his head reprovingly
 you be in mistake
 you be inclined to put the haul earlier the horse
 earlier one ask myself where this man disappear to
 one ask myself such man very exist
 because you see if the man be an much easy to have him disappear
 so one try to prove first that there reallyis such person
 and have arrive at the fact that there bien where be he now
 there be only two answer to that mon cher
 either he be still hide on the train in put of such extraordinary ingenuity that we can not even think of it or else he be one might say two person
 that be he be both man fear by thousand passenger on the train so well disguise that thousand ratchett not spot him
 it be an idea that say thousand bouc his face light up
 then it cloud over again
 merely there be one poirot take the word out of his talk
 the height of the man
 it be that you would say
 with the exception of mr ratchett second valet all the passenger be big italian colonel arbuthnot hector macqueen count andrenyi
 well that leaf u the very probably guess
 merely there be another possibility
 remember the womanish voice
 that give u choice of alternative
 the man may be disguise woman or alternatively he may actuallybe woman
 tall woman dress in man second dress would look little
 merely surely ratchett would have possibly hedid know
 possibly already this woman have try his life break mare dress the well to accomplish her purpose
 ratchett may have think that she would use the like trick again so he tell hardman to look man
 merely he note however womanish voice
 it be possibility say thousand bouc
 listen my friend one think that one should now tell you of certain inconsistency notice by dr
 constantine
 he retail at length the conclusion that he and the doctor have arrive at together from the nature of the dead man second wound
 thousand bouc groan and have his head again
 one know say poirot sympathetically
 one know precisely how you find
 the head spin it not
 the whole thing be fantasy
 cry thousand bouc
 precisely
 it be can not be
 so one myself have say
 and even my friend there it be
 one can not miss from the fact
 it be madness
 be it not
 it be so mad my friend that sometimes one be haunt by the sense that very it must be very simple

 merely that be only one of my little idea
 two murderer groan thousand bouc
 and on the orient the think about have him cry
 and now get u have the fantasy more fantastic say poirot cheerfully
 last night on the train there be two mysterious stranger
 there be the wagon light attendant answer to the description give u by thousand hardman and see by hildegarde schmidt colonel arbuthnot and thousand macqueen
 there be besides woman in red tall slender woman see by pierre michel miss debenham thousand macqueen and myself and smell one may say by colonel arbuthnot
 who be she
 one on the train admit to have scarlet kimono
 she besides have disappear
 be she one and the like with the spurious wagon light attendant
 or be she some quite distinct personality
 where be they these two
 and incidentally where be the wagon light uniform and the scarlet kimono
 ah
 that be something definite
 thousand bouc form up eagerly
 we must search all the passenger baggage
 yes that will be something
 poirot rise besides
 one will have prophecy he say
 you know where they be
 one have little idea
 where then
 you will find the scarlet kimono in the baggage of one of the man and you will find the uniform of the wagon light conductor in the baggage of hildegarde schmidt
 hildegarde schmidt
 you not what you be think
 one will put it like this
 if hildegarde schmidt be guilty the uniform may be found in her baggage
 merely if she be innocent itcertainly will be
 merely begin thousand bouc and end
 what be this noise that approach
 he cry
 it resembles locomotive in gesture
 the noise pull near
 it consist of shrill cry and protest in woman second voice
 the door at the end of the burst open
 mr hubbard burst in
 it second besides horrible
 she cry
 it second just besides horrible
 in my
 my
 big over blood
 and suddenly tumble forward she faint heavy on thousand bouc second shoulder
 the tell of the weapon with more energy than chivalry bouc deposit the faint lady with her head on the table
 dr constantine cry one of the restaurant attendant who come at move
 keep her head so say the doctor
 if she revive give her little cognac
 you understand
 then he hurry murder after the other two
 his interest put wholly in the lady not interest him at all
 it be possible that mr hubbard revive quite more quickly by these method than she might otherwise have
 few minute later she be sit up sip cognac from glass suggestion by the attendant and speak once more
 one just ca nt tell you how frightful it be
 one nt think anybody on this train can understand my find
 one ve always be very very sensitive always since one be child
 the mere view of
 why even now one have faint when one think about it
 the attendant suggestion the glass again
 encore un peu madame
 dyou think one d well
 one thousand lifelong teetotaller
 one never touch heart or wine at any time
 all my class be abstainer
 still possibly this be only she sip once more
 in the meanwhile poirot and thousand bouc close be by dr constantine have hurry out of the restaurant car and along the corridor of the stamboul coach towards mr hubbard second compartment
 every traveller on the train look to be congregate away the door
 the conductor harass look on his face be keep them back
 il ny rienàvoir he say and repeat the opinion in several other language
 get pas if you please say thousand bouc
 squeeze his rotundity by the obstruct passenger he enter the compartment poirot close behind him
 one be glad you have come monsieur say the conductor with sigh of relief
 everyone have be try to enter
 the american scream she one think she besides have be murder
 one come at move and there she be scream like mad woman and she cry out that she must fetch you and she go scream at the clear of her voice and tell everybody whose carriage she pass what have happen
 he add with gesture of the hand itis in there monsieur
 one have not touch it
 attend on the handle of the door that give access to the next compartment be rubber
 under it on the shock just where it have drop from mr hubbard second hand be cheap matter fake oriental with an emboss hilt and taper blade
 the blade be stain with spot of what look like rust
 poirot foot it up delicately
 yes he murmur
 there be mistake
 here be our miss weapon all doctor
 the doctor examine it
 you want not be so careful say poirot
 there will be fingerprint on it write those of mr
 hubbard
 constantine second examination not take long
 it be the weapon all good he say
 it would explanation any of the wound
 one beg you my friend not say that
 the doctor look astonish
 already we be heavy overburden by coincidence
 two people decide to stab thousand ratchett last night
 it be besides much of well thing that both of them should choice the like weapon
 to that the coincidence be not possibly so big it look say the doctor
 thousand of these fake eastern dagger be have and ship to the bazaar of constantinople
 you console little merely only little say poirot
 he look thoughtfully at the door in front of him then rise murder the he try the handle
 the door not stir
 about foot above the handle be the door bolt
 poirot pull it back and try again merely still the door remain fast
 we lock it from the other side you remember say the doctor
 that be true say poirot absently
 he look to be think about something else
 his eyebrow be furrow though in perplexity
 it agree it not
 say thousand bouc
 the man pass through this carriage
 he close the communicate door behind him he find the
 think come to him and he quickly case the knife inside
 then all unwitting that he have awaken mr hubbard he case out through the other door into the corridor
 you say murmur poirot
 that be how it must have find
 merely the puzzle look not leave his face
 merely what be it
 need thousand bouc
 there be something be there not that not meet you
 poirot dart promptly take at him
 the like point not strike you
 obviously not
 well it be little matter
 the conductor look into the carriage
 the american lady be come back
 dr constantine look quite guilty
 he have he find cover mr hubbard quite cavalierly
 merely she have reproach him
 her energy be concentrate on another matter
 one thousand go to say one thing good out she say breathlessly she arrive in the doorway
 one thousand not go on any long in this compartment
 why one would nt sleep in it if you give million dollar
 merely one know what you be go to say and one thousand tell you good now that one wo nt any such thing
 why one d quite sit up all night in the corridor
 she begin to cry
 oh if my daughter could only she could see now poirot interrupt hard
 you misunderstand madame
 your need be about fair
 your baggage shall be change at once to another compartment
 mr hubbard low her handkerchief
 be that so
 oh
 one find well good off
 merely surely it second all full unless one of the thousand bouc spoke
 your baggage madame shall be go out of this coach altogether
 you shall have compartment in the next coach which be put on at belgrade
 why that second excellent
 one thousand not an extra nervous woman merely to sleep in that compartment next door to dead man
 she tremble
 it would force clean crazy
 michel name thousand bouc
 go this baggage into vacant compartment in the coach
 yes monsieur
 the like one

 say poirot earlier his friend could answer
 one think it would be well madame to have different count altogether
 the
 case
 bien monsieur
 the conductor assume the baggage
 mr hubbard go appreciatively to poirot
 that second very kind and delicate of you
 one appreciate it one see you
 not note it madame
 we will come with you and see you well instal
 mr hubbard be see by the three man to her new family
 she look turn her happily
 this be fine
 it become you madame
 it be you see precisely like the compartment you have left
 that second it face the other way
 merely that nt matter these train go first one way and then the other
 one say to my daughter one want carriage face the engine
 and she say why ma that ll be well to you if you go to sleep one way when you wake up the train second go the other
 and it be quite true what she say
 why last even we go into belgrade one way and out the other
 at any rate madame you be quite glad and subject now
 well one would nt say that
 here we be stay in snowdrift and nobody anything about it and my boat sail the day after
 madame say thousand bouc we be all in the like one of u
 well that second true admit mr hubbard
 merely nobody else have have murderer walk good through her compartment in the middle of the night
 what still puzzle madame say poirot be how the man have into your compartment if the communicate door be bolt you say
 you be sure that itwas bolt
 why the swedish lady try it earlier my eye
 get u just reconstruct that little view
 you be lie in your you could not see yourself you say
 because of the
 oh
 my one shall have to have new
 it have find pale at my stomach to look at this one
 poirot foot up the and attend it on the handle of the communicate door into the next carriage
 précisément
 one see he say
 the bolt be just underneath the mask it
 you could not see from where you be lie whether the bolt be go or not
 why that second just what one ve be tell you
 and the swedish lady miss ohlsson stand so between you and the door
 she try it and tell you it be bolt
 that second so
 all the like madame she may have have an mistake
 you see what one mean
 poirot look anxious to explain
 the bolt be just projection of
 when it be go to the good the door be lock
 when it be left true the door be unlock
 possibly she merely try the door and it be lock on the other side she may have assume that it be lock on your side
 well one think that would be quite stupid of her
 madame the about kind the about amiable be not always the apt
 that second so of course
 by the way madame you travel out to smyrna this way

 one sail good to stamboul and friend of my daughter second mr johnson perfectly lovely man one d like to have you know him touch and show all turn stamboul
 merely it be very disappoint tumble down and those mosque and put on those big shuffle thing over your be one
 you be say that mr johnson touch you
 that second so and he see on board french messageries boat smyrna and my daughter second husband be wait good on the quay
 what he ll say when he hear about all this
 my daughter say this would be just the safe easy way imaginable
 you just sit in your carriage she say and you down good in parrus and there the american express will touch you
 and oh dear what be one to about natural my steamship passing
 one ought to get them know
 one ca nt possibly have it now
 this be just besides mr hubbard show sign of tear once more
 poirot who have be fidget slightly assume his opportunity
 you have have shock madame
 the restaurant attendant shall be teach to bring you along some tea and some biscuit
 one nt know that one thousand so put on tea say mr hubbard tearfully
 that second more an english habit
 coffee then madame
 you want some that cognac second have my head find mighty curious
 one think one would like some coffee
 excellent
 you must revive your force
 my what curious expression
 merely first madame little matter of act
 you let that one have search of your baggage
 what
 we be about to begin search of all the passenger baggage
 one not want to remind you of an unpleasant have merely your
 mercy
 possibly you d well
 one just could nt hold to have any more surprise of that kind
 the examination be quickly over
 mr hubbard be travel with the minimum of cheap bag and travel pocket
 the subject of all three be simple and square and the examination would not have take more than couple of minute have not mr hubbard delay matter by insist on due attention be give to photograph of my daughter and of two quite ugly my daughter second child
 be nt they cunning
 the tell of the passenger baggage have deliver himself of various polite insincerity and have tell mr hubbard that he would order coffee to be bring to her poirot be able to take his leave company by his two friend
 well we have have begin and pull space watch thousand bouc
 whom shall we approach next
 it would be simple one think just to go along the train carriage by carriage
 that mean that we begin with
 amiable mr
 hardman
 mr hardman who be smoke cigar welcome them affably
 come good in gentleman
 that be if it second humanly possible
 it second just touch hamper in here party
 thousand bouc explain the object of their inflict and the big detective nod comprehendingly
 that second ok
 to tell the truth one ve be wonder you nt have down to it sooner
 here be my key gentleman and if you like to search my pocket besides why you re welcome
 shall one pass the handle down you
 the conductor will that
 michel
 the subject of mr hardman second two handle be soon examine and pass
 they hold possibly an undue proportion of spirituous liquor
 mr hardman wink
 it second not much they search your handle at the if you fix the conductor
 one hand out chew of turkish notice good off and there second be trouble so far
 and atparis
 mr hardman wink again
 by the time one have to paris he say what second left over of this little set will go into bottle label hairwash
 you be not believer in prohibition monsieur hardman say thousand bouc with smile
 well say hardman one ca nt say prohibition have always worry any
 ah
 say thousand bouc
 the speakeasy
 he pronounce the word with wish enjoy it
 your american term be so quaint so expressive he say
 one would much like to go to america say poirot
 you d learn few method over there say hardman
 europe want wake up
 she second half asleep
 it be true that america be the country of advance agree poirot
 there be much that one admire about american
 be possibly one find the american woman less charm than my own countrywoman
 the french or the belgian daughter coquettish think there be one to touch her
 hardman go off to peer out at the snow minute
 possibly you re good thousand poirot he say
 merely one think every state like it own daughter well
 he wink though the snow distress his eye
 kind of dazzle be nt it
 he note
 say gentleman this business be have on my heart
 murder and the snow and all
 and nothingdoing
 just attend about and kill time
 one d like to have busy after person or something
 the true western heart of hustle say poirot with smile
 the conductor replace the pocket and they go on to the next compartment
 colonel arbuthnot be sit in corner smoke pipe and take magazine
 poirot explain their errand
 the colonel have demur
 he have two big leather bag
 the lie of my kit have go by long sea he explain
 like about army man the colonel be neat packer
 the examination of his baggage take only few minute
 poirot notice packet of
 you always use the like kind
 he ask
 normally
 if one can have
 ah
 poirot nod
 these match precisely with the one he have found on the shock of the dead man second compartment
 dr constantine note much when they be out in the corridor again
 tout même murmur poirot one can hardly think it
 it be notdans son caractère and when you have say that you have say everything
 the door of the next compartment be close
 it be that take by princess dragomiroff
 they knock on the door and the princess second deep voice name entrez
 thousand bouc be spokesman
 he be very deferential and polite he explain their errand
 the princess listen to him in silence her little face quite impassive
 if it be necessary monsieur she say quietly when he have end that be all there be to it
 my maid have the key
 she will serve to it with you
 your maid always hold your key madame
 ask poirot
 surely monsieur
 and if during the night at one of the frontier the custom official should ask man of baggage to be open
 the old lady shrug her shoulder
 it be very unlikely
 merely in such case the conductor would fetch her
 you believe her then implicitly madame
 one have tell you so already say the princess quietly
 one not use people whom one not believe
 yes say poirot thoughtfully
 believe be indeed something in these day
 it be possibly well to have homely woman whom one can believe than morechic case some bright parisienne
 he see the night intelligent eye come slowly turn and fasten themselves upon his face
 what precisely be you incriminate thousand
 poirot
 nothing madame
 one
 nothing
 merely yes
 you think you not that one should have bright frenchwoman to serve to my toilet
 it would be possibly more usual madame
 she shook her head
 schmidt be give to
 her voice harp lingeringly on the word
 impayable
 the german woman have arrive with the key
 the princess spoke to her in her own language tell her to open the valise and help the gentleman in their search
 she herself remain in the corridor look out at the snow and poirot remain with her leave thousand bouc to the job of search the baggage
 she see him with black smile
 well monsieur you not wish to see what my valise hold
 he shook his head
 madame it be formality that be all
 be you so sure
 in your case yes
 and even one know and love sonia armstrong
 what you think then
 that one would not dirty my hand with kill suchcanaille that man cassetti
 well possibly you be good
 she be silent minute or two
 then she say with such man that you know what one should have like to
 one should have like to name to my servant flog this man to end and crack him out on the rubbish pile
 that be the way thing be when one be young monsieur
 still he not speak just listen attentively
 she look at him with sudden impetuosity
 you not say anything thousand poirot
 what be it that you be think one wonder
 he look at her with very address glance
 one think madame that your force be in your in your weapon
 she glance down at her thin weapon end in those yellow hand with the call on the feel
 it be true she say
 one have force in
 one not know whether one be blue or glad
 then she go abruptly back towards her carriage where the maid be busily carry up the case
 the princess cut light thousand bouc second apology
 there be want you to apologise monsieur she say
 murder have be give
 certain action have to be perform
 that be all there be to it
 vousêtes bien aimable madame
 she inclined her head slightly they go
 the door of the next two carriage be shut
 thousand bouc pause and start his head
 diable
 he say
 this may be awkward
 these be diplomatic pass
 their baggage be excuse
 from custom examination yes
 merely murder be different
 one know
 all the not want to have complication
 not distress yourself my friend
 the count and count will be fair
 see how amiable princess dragomiroff be about it
 she be trulygrande dame
 these two be besides of the like put merely the count print man of slightly truculent disposition
 he be not please when you insist on question his wife
 and this will annoy him still far
 neglect them
 after all they can have nothing to with the matter
 why should one raise up needle trouble myself
 one not agree with you say poirot
 one find sure that count andrenyi will be fair
 at any rate get u have the try
 and earlier thousand bouc could answer he tap sharply on the door of

 voice from inside cry entrez
 the count be sit in the corner about the door take newspaper
 the count be lock up in the opposite corner about the window
 there be pillow behind her head and she look to have be asleep
 pardon monsieur le comte begin poirot
 pray forgive this intrusion
 it be that we be have search of all the baggage on the train
 in about case mere formality
 merely it have to be
 thousand bouc suggest that you have diplomatic pass you might reasonably call to be excuse from such search
 the count see moment
 thank you he say
 merely one not think that one wish to have an exception have in my case
 one should prefer that our baggage should be examine like that of the other passenger
 he go to his wife
 you not object one hope elena
 not at all say the count without hesitation
 rapid and slightly casual search be
 poirot look to be try to mask an embarrassment by have various little pointless note such here be label all wet on your bag madame he rise down blue morocco case with initial on it and coronet
 the count not answer to this notice
 she look indeed quite hold by the whole go remain lock up in her corner and star dreamily out through the window whilst the man search her baggage in the compartment next door
 poirot end his search by open the little cupboard above the washbasin and take rapid glance at it sponge face cream powder and little bottle label trional
 then with polite note on either side the search party recall

 poirot

 and be what be curious
 on this we have delay
 and this time more good delay since there be possibility of commit telegram to your friend or of have them on the long distance
 the call you mean
 ah yes the portmanteau name you say inengland
 mary debenham smile little in hurt of herself
 trunk name she right
 yes you say it be extremely annoy not to be able to have any word through either by call or by cable
 and even mademoiselle this time your manner be quite different
 you long fail the impatience
 you be calm and philosophic
 mary debenham flush and moment her lip
 she long find inclined to smile
 you not answer mademoiselle
 one be blue
 one not know that there be anything to answer
 your change of position mademoiselle
 nt you think that you be have quite mother about nothing thousand
 poirot
 poirot spread out his hand in an apologetic gesture
 it be possibly mistake with u detective
 we ask the behaviour to be always consistent
 we not let change of temper
 mary debenham have answer
 you know colonel arbuthnot well mademoiselle
 he fancy that she be still by the change of subject
 one touch him the first time on this travel
 have you any reason to suspect that he may have know this man ratchett
 she shook her head decisively
 one be quite sure he nt
 why be you sure
 by the way he spoke
 and even mademoiselle we found on the shock of the dead man second compartment
 and colonel arbuthnot be the only man on the train who smoke pipe
 he watch her narrowly merely she display neither surprise nor emotion merely say nonsense
 it second absurd
 colonel arbuthnot be the last man in the world to be shuffle up in theatrical kind of crime like this
 it be so much what poirot himself think that he found himself on the point of agree with her
 he say rather one must remind you that you not know him very well mademoiselle
 she shrug her shoulder
 one know the character well enough
 he say very gently you still refuse to tell the mean of those word when it second behind u
 she answer coldly one have nothing more to say
 it not matter say hercule poirot
 one shall find out
 he bow and left the compartment close the door after him
 be that wise my friend
 ask thousand bouc
 you have put her on her through her you have put the colonel on his guard besides
 mon ami if you wish to get rabbit you put ferret into the fix and if the rabbit be move
 that be all one have
 they enter the compartment of hildegarde schmidt
 the woman be stand in set her face respectful merely unemotional
 poirot take promptly glance through the subject of the little case on the seat
 then he gesture to the attendant to have down the big bag from the rack
 the key
 he say
 it be not lock monsieur
 poirot undid the hasp and rise the hat
 aha
 he say and go to thousand bouc you remember what one say
 look here little moment
 on the clear of the bag be hurriedly brown wagon light uniform
 the stolidity of the german woman undergo sudden change
 ach
 she cry
 that be not mine
 one not put it there
 one have never look in that case since we left stamboul
 indeed indeed it be true
 she look from one to another of the man pleadingly
 poirot take her gently by the weapon and soothe her
 all be well
 we think you
 not be agitate
 one be sure you not hide the uniform there one be sure that you be well cook
 see
 youare well cook be you not
 bewilder the woman smile in hurt of herself yes indeed all my lady have say so
 she end her talk open look frighten again
 say poirot
 one see you all be well
 see one will tell you how this find
 this man the man you see in wagon light uniform come out of the dead man second compartment
 he collide with you
 that be bad luck him
 he have hop that one will see him
 what to next
 he must have rid of his uniform
 it be now not precaution merely danger
 his glance go to thousand bow and dr constantine who be listen attentively
 there be the snow you see
 the snow which confuse all his plan
 where can he hide these dress
 all the compartment be full
 he pass one whose door be open show it to be unoccupied
 it must be the one belong to the woman with whom he have just collide
 he case in murder the uniform and fix it hurriedly into bag on the rack
 it may be some time earlier it be discover
 and then
 say thousand bouc
 that we must discus poirot say with warn glance
 he have up the tunic
 button the third down be miss
 poirot case his hand into the pocket and take out conductor second use to unlock the door of the compartment
 here be the explanation of how one man be able to pas through lock door say thousand bouc
 your question to mr hubbard be unnecessary
 lock or not lock the man could well have through the communicate door
 after all if wagon light uniform why not wagon light key
 why not indeed
 return poirot
 we might have know it very
 you remember that michel say that the door into the corridor of mr hubbard second compartment be lock when he come in answer to her bell
 that be so monsieur say the conductor
 that be why one think the lady must have be dream
 merely now it be easy continued thousand bouc
 doubtless he mean to relock the communicate door besides merely possibly he heard some movement from the bed and it startle him
 we have now say poirot only to find the scarlet kimono
 true
 and these last two compartment be take by man
 we will search all the like
 oh
 assuredly
 besides one remember what you say
 hector macqueen assent willingly in the search
 one d just soon you he say with rueful smile
 one find one thousand decidedly the about suspicious character on the train
 you ve only have to find will in which the old man left all his money and that ll just about fix thing
 thousand bouc bent suspicious glance upon him
 that second only my fun add macqueen hurriedly
 he d never have left cent very
 one be just useful to and so on
 you re probably to be out of luck you know if you nt speak anything merely well american
 one thousand linguist myself merely one know what one name shopping and moment in french and german and italian
 his voice be little loud than usual
 it be though he be slightly anxious over the search in hurt of his express willingness
 poirot issue
 nothing he say
 not even compromise bequest
 macqueen sigh
 well that second load murder my mind he say humorously
 they go on to the last compartment
 the examination of the baggage of the big italian and of the valet give leave
 the three man stand at the end of the coach look at each other
 what next
 say thousand bouc
 we will go back to the say poirot
 we know now all that we can know
 we have the tell of the passenger the tell of their baggage the tell of our eye
 we can ask far help
 it must be our part now to use our mind
 he find in his pocket his cigarette case
 it be empty
 one will connect you in moment he say
 one shall want the cigarette
 this be very difficult very curious matter
 who break that scarlet kimono
 where be it now
 one wish one know
 there be something in this miss
 it be difficult because it have beenmade difficult
 merely we will discus it
 pardon moment
 he go hurriedly along the corridor to his own compartment
 he have he know far add of cigarette in one of his valise
 he have it down and tear back the lock
 then he sit back on his list and star
 neatly fold on the clear of the case be thin scarlet silk kimono embroider with dragon
 so he murmur
 it be like that
 defiance
 very well one take it up
 part three hercule poirot sit back and think which of them
 thousand bouc
 and dr constantine be speak together when poirot enter the
 thousand bouc be look lower
 le voilà say the latter when he see poirot
 then he add his friend sit down if you clear this case mon cher one shall indeed think in miracle
 it worry you this case
 naturally it worry
 one can not have head or tail of it
 one agree say the doctor
 he look at poirot with interest
 to be frank he say one can not see what you be go to next

 say poirot thoughtfully
 he take out his cigarette case and light one of his tiny cigarette
 his eye be dreamy
 that to be the interest of this case he say
 we be cut murder from all the normal route of routine
 be these people whose tell we have take speak the truth or lie
 we have mean of find such mean we can invent ourselves
 it be an use this of the mind
 that be all very fine say thousand bouc
 merely what have you to go upon
 one tell you just now
 we have the tell of the passenger and the tell of our own eye
 pretty of the passenger
 it tell u just nothing at all
 poirot shook his head
 one not agree my friend
 the tell of the passenger give u several point of interest
 indeed say thousand bouc sceptically
 one not watch it
 that be because you not listen
 well tell what one miss
 one will just take one first tell we heard that of the young macqueen
 he talk to my mind one very meaning phrase
 about the letter
 not about the letter
 far one can remember his word be we travel about
 mr ratchett want to see the world
 he be hamper by know language
 one work more courier than secretary
 he look from the doctor second face to that of thousand bouc
 what
 you still not see
 that be you have moment find again just now when he say you re probably to be out of luck if you nt speak anything merely well american
 you
 thousand bouc still look puzzle
 ah it be that you want it give to you in word of one syllable
 well here it be thousand
 ratchett spoke french
 even when the conductor come in answer to his bell last night it be voice speak infrench that tell him that it be mistake and that he be not want
 it be moreover perfectly idiomatic phrase that be use not one that man know only few word of french would have choice
 ce nest rien je suis trompé
 it be true criedconstantine excitedly
 we should have see that
 one remember your put try on the word when you repeat them to u
 now one understand your reluctance to trust upon the tell of the dent watch
 already at minute to one ratchett be and it be his murderer speak
 end thousand bouc impressively
 poirot raise deprecate hand
 get u not go besides fast
 and not get u assume more than we actually know
 it be safe one think to say that at that minute to other personwas in ratchett second compartment and that that person either be french or could speak the french language fluently
 you be very timid mon vieux one should advance only tone at time
 we have actualevidence that ratchett be dead at that time
 there be the cry that awaken you
 yes that be true
 in one way say thousand bouc thoughtfully this discovery not involve thing very much
 you heard person go about next door
 that person be not ratchett merely the other man
 doubtless he be wash blood from his hand pass up after the crime cut the incriminate letter
 then he wait till all be still and when he think it be safe and the coast be pass he lock and chain ratchett second door on the inside unlock the communicate door through into mr hubbard second compartment and case out that way
 in fact it be precisely we think with the difference that ratchett be kill about half an hour earlier and the watch put on to quarter by one to make an alibi
 not such famous alibi say poirot
 the hand of the watch point to demand time when the intruder actually left the view of the crime
 true say thousand bouc little confuse
 what then the watch bring to you
 if the hand be sayif the time at which they be setmust have meaning
 the natural reaction would be to suspect anyone who have reliable alibi the time this case
 yes yes say the doctor
 that reason be well
 we must besides give little attention to the time the intruderentered the compartment
 when have he an opportunity of so
 unless we be to assume the complicity of the very conductor there be only one time when he could have the time the train end at vincovci
 after the train left vincovci the conductor be sit face the corridor and whereas any one of the passenger would give little attention to wagon light attendant theone person whowould notice an impostor be the very conductor
 merely during the stop at vincovci the conductor be out on the platform
 the coast be pass
 and by our early reason itmust be one of the passenger say thousand bouc
 we come back to where we be
 which of them
 poirot smile
 one have have number he say
 if you like to see it it will possibly review your memory
 the doctor and thousand bouc concentrate over the number together
 it be write out neatly in methodical manner in the order in which the passenger have be interview

 notice tell of the passenger be back by the statement of the conductor that one enter or left mr ratchett second compartment from midnight to oclock when he himself go into the next coach and from to oclock
 that document you understand say poirot be mereprécis of the tell we heard arrange in that way convenience
 with grimace thousand bouc hand it back
 it be not clear he say
 possibly you may find this more to your taste say poirot with little smile he hand him moment sheet of paper
 ten question on the paper be write thing want explanation
 the handkerchief notice with the initial henry whose be it

 the
 be it drop by colonel arbuthnot
 or by person else
 who break the scarlet kimono
 who be the man or woman masquerade in wagon light uniform

 why the hand of the watch point to

 be the murder give at that time

 be it earlier

 be it later

 can we be sure that ratchett be stab by more than one person

 what other explanation of his wound can there be
 well get u see what we can say thousand bouc brighten little at this challenge to his brain
 the handkerchief to begin with
 get u by all mean be neat and methodical
 assuredly say poirot nod his head in meet manner
 thousand bouc continued slightly didactically
 the initial henry be connect with three hubbard miss debenham whose moment name be hermione and the maid hildegarde schmidt
 ah
 and of those three
 it be difficult to say
 merely ithink one should vote miss debenham
 all one know she may be name by her moment name and not her first
 besides there be already some suspicion attach to her
 that conversation you catch mon cher be surely little curious and so be her refusal to explain it
 one plump the american say dr constantine
 it be very expensive handkerchief that and american all the world know not wish what they give
 so you both eliminate the maid
 ask poirot
 yes
 she herself say it be the handkerchief of member of the upper course
 and the moment
 colonel arbuthnot drop it or person else
 that be more difficult
 the english they not stab
 you be good there
 one incline to the see that person else drop the so to incriminate the englishman
 you say thousand poirot put in the doctor twoclues be besides much negligence
 one agree with thousand bouc
 the handkerchief be genuine none of the woman will admit that it be hers
 the be fake clue
 in back of that theory you notice that colonel arbuthnot show embarrassment and admit freely to smoke pipe and use that character of clean
 you reason well say poirot
 question
 break the scarlet kimono
 go on thousand bouc
 to that one will confess one have not the little idea
 have you any see on the subject dr
 constantine
 none
 then we confess ourselves beat there
 the next question have at any rate possibility
 who be the man or the woman masquerade in wagon light uniform
 well one can number with certainty count of people that it could not have be
 hardman colonel arbuthnot foscarelli count andrenyi and hector macqueen be all besides tall
 mr hubbard hildegarde schmidt and greta ohlsson be besides broad
 that leaf the valet miss debenham princess dragomiroff and count none of them good probably
 greta ohlsson in one case and antonio foscarelli in the other both trust that miss debenham and the valet never left their compartment
 hildegarde schmidt trust that the princess be in hers and count andrenyi have tell u that his wife take sleep draught
 therefore it look impossible that it can be be absurd
 our old friend euclid say murmur poirot
 it must be one of those four say dr constantine
 unless it be person from away who have found that we agree be impossible
 thousand bouc have pass on to the next question on the number

 the hand of the pause watch point to
 one can see two explanation of that
 either it be by the murderer to prove an alibi and afterwards when he mean to leave the compartment he be prevent by hear people go about or have an idea the other two wait respectfully while thousand bouc struggle in mental agony
 one have it he say at last
 it be not the wagon light murderer who tamper with the watch
 it be the person we have name the moment other word the woman in the scarlet kimono
 she arrive later and go back the hand of the watch in order to have an alibi herself
 assassin say dr constantine
 it be well think that
 in fact say poirot she stab him in the night not understand that he be dead already merely somehow deduce that he have watch in his pyjama pocket take it out put back the hand blindly and give it the necessity dent
 thousand bouc look at him coldly
 have you anything well to suggest yourself
 he ask
 at the admit poirot
 all the like he go on one not think you have either of you appreciate the about interest point about that watch
 question
 hand with it
 ask the doctor
 to that the murder give at that time answerno
 one agree say thousand bouc
 be it earlier
 be the next question
 one
 you besides doctor
 the doctor nod
 yes merely the question be it later
 can besides be answer in the affirmative
 one agree with your theory thousand bouc and so one think thousand poirot although he not wish to give himself
 the first murderer come earlier than
 merely the moment murderer cameafter
 and see the question of ought we not to take tone to see which of the passenger be
 one have not completely fail that point say poirot
 you may have notice that one have each passenger write either touch or an address
 that be not conclusive because some people certain action with the good hand and others with the left
 some write merely turn golf
 still it be something
 every person question take the write in his or her good the exception of princess dragomiroff who refuse to write
 princess say thousand bouc
 one doubt if she would have have the force to inflict that blow say dr constantine doubtfully
 that particular wound have be inflict with considerable force
 more force than woman could use
 one would not say that
 merely one think more force than an elderly woman could display and princess dragomiroff second physique be particularly delicate
 it might be question of the charm of mind over body say poirot
 princess dragomiroff have big personality and huge
 merely get u pas from that the moment
 to question
 and
 can we be sure that ratchett be stab by more than one person and what other explanation of the wound can there be
 in my opinion medically speak there can beno other explanation of those wound
 to suggest that one man strike first feebly and then with violence first with the good hand and then with the left and after an interval of possibly half an hour inflict clean wound on dead it not have feel
 say poirot
 it not have feel
 and you think that two murderer have feel
 you yourself have say what other explanation can there be
 poirot star true ahead of him
 that be what one ask myself he say
 that be what one never end to ask myself
 he lean back in his seat
 from now on it be all here
 he tapped himself on the brow
 we have cream it all out
 the fact be all in front of arrange with order and method
 the passenger have sit here one by one give their tell
 we know all that can be away
 he give thousand bouc an affectionate smile
 it have be little joke between u have it business of sit back andthinking out the truth
 well one be about to put my theory into earlier your eye
 you two must the like
 get u all three close our eye andthink
 one or more of those passenger kill ratchettwhich of them
 certain suggestive point it be quite quarter of an hour earlier anyone spoke
 thousand bouc and dr constantine have begin by try to obey poirot second direction
 they have attempt to see through maze of conflict particular to pass and great solution
 thousand bouc second think have move something be assuredly one must think
 merely far that go one have already think
 poirot obviously think that this english daughter be shuffle up in the matter
 one can not help find that that be about unlikely

 the english be extremely cold
 probably it be because they have name

 merely that be not the point
 it look that the italian could not have pity
 one think the english valet be not lie when he say the other never left the compartment
 merely why should he
 it be not easy to bribe the english they be so unapproachable
 the whole thing be about unfortunate
 one wonder when we shall have out of this
 there must besome rescue make in advance
 they be so slowly in these country it be hour earlier anyone think of anything
 and the police of these country they will be about try to hand up with importance delicate on their dignity
 they will have thousand matter of all this
 it be not much that such find come their way
 it will be in all the newspaper
 and from there on thousand bouc second think go along course which they have already cross some hundred time
 dr constantine second think move therefore he be curious this little man
 genius
 or crank
 will he clear this mystery
 can see way out of it
 it be all besides confuse
 everyone be lie possibly

 merely even then that not help one
 if they be all lie it be just confuse if they be speak the truth
 curious about those wound
 one can not understand it

 it would be easy to understand if he have be all the term gunman must mean that they tear with gunman
 curious country america
 one should like to go there
 it be so progressive
 when one have family one must have have of demetrius have be to america he have all the advanced idea

 one wonder what zia be at this moment
 if my wife always find his think go on to entirely private matter
 hercule poirot sit very still
 one might have think he be asleep
 and then suddenly after quarter of an hour second complete immobility his eyebrow begin to go slowly up his brow
 little sigh miss him
 he murmur below his breath
 merely after all why not
 and if if so that would explain everything
 his eye open
 they be green like cat second
 he say softly eh bien
 one have think
 and you
 miss in their expression both man begin violently
 one have think besides say thousand bouc just shade guiltily
 merely one have arrive at conclusion
 the elucidation of crime be yourmétier not mine my friend
 one besides have reflect with big earnestness say the doctor unblushingly remember his think from certain pornographic detail
 one have think of many possible theory merely not one that very meet
 poirot nod affably
 his nod look to say quite good
 that be the proper thing to say
 you have give the clue one ask
 he sit very good give out his breast caress his moustache and spoke in the manner of rehearse speaker address public touch
 my friend one have review the fact in my mind and have besides go over to myself the tell of the this leave one see nebulously even certain explanation that would top the fact we know them
 it be very curious explanation and one can not be sure even that it be the true one
 to find out decidedly one shall have to have certain experiment
 one would like first to note certain point which look to suggestive
 get u begin with note have to by thousand bouc in this very put on the affair of our first lunch together on the train
 he remark on the fact that we be wall by people of all course of all age of all nationality
 that be fact slightly rare at this time of year
 the and the coach case be about empty
 remember besides the passenger who fail to go up
 he be one think meaning
 then there be some child point that strike case the put of mr hubbard second the name of mr armstrong second mother the detective method of thousand hardman the suggestion of thousand macqueen that ratchett himself destroyed the char notice we found princess dragomiroff second christian name and grease point on hungarian pass
 the two man star at him
 they suggest anything to you those point
 ask poirot
 not thing say thousand bouc honestly
 andm
 le docteur
 one not understand in the least what you be speak of
 thousand bouc meanwhile assume upon the one real thing his friend have note be kind through the pass
 with grunt he foot up that of count and count andrenyi and open it
 be this what you mean
 this dirty notice
 yes
 it be fairly clean grease point
 you notice where it happen
 at the begin of the description of the count second christian name to be demand
 merely one confess that one still not see the point
 one be go to approach it from another lean
 get u go back to the handkerchief found at the view of the crime
 we express not long ago three people be companion with the letter henry mr hubbard miss debenham and the maid hildegarde schmidt
 now get u see that handkerchief from another point of see
 it be my friend an extremely expensive luxe embroider in paris
 which of the passenger aside from the initial be probably to own such handkerchief
 not mr hubbard worthy woman with pretension to reckless extravagance in dress
 not miss course of englishwoman have dainty linen handkerchief not an expensive wisp of cambric cost possibly two hundred franc
 and surely not the maid
 merely thereare two woman on the tram who would be probably to own such handkerchief
 get u see if we can connect them in any way with the letter henry the two woman one mention to be princess whose christian name be natalia put in thousand bouc ironically
 precisely
 and her christian name one say just now be decidedly suggestive
 the other woman be count andrenyi
 and at once something strike you
 then
 her christian name on her pass be disfigure by spot of grease
 just an accident anyone would say
 merely see that christian name
 elena
 think that rather of elena it werehelena
 that capital henry could be go into capital and then move over the smalle next to it quite then point of grease drop to top up the change
 helena
 cry thousand bouc
 it be an idea that
 surely it be an idea
 one look about any confirmation however little of my one find it
 one of the baggage label on the count second baggage be slightly muffle
 it be one that find to move over the first initial on clear of the case
 that label have be soak murder and put on again in different put
 you begin to convince say thousand bouc
 merely the count ah now mon vieux you must go yourself turn and approach an entirely different lean of the case
 how be this murder mean to look to everybody
 not forget that the snow have upset all the murderer second master plan
 get u think little minute that there be snow that the train go on it normal course
 what then would have find
 the murder get u say would still have be discover in all probability at the italian frontier early this morning
 much of the like tell would have be give to the italian police
 the threaten letter would have be produce by thousand macqueen thousand hardman would have tell his story mr hubbard would have be eager to tell how man pass through her compartment the button would have be found
 one think that two thing only would have be different
 the man would have pass through mr hubbard second compartment just earlier one the wagon light uniform would have be found cast murder in one of the toilet
 you mean
 one mean that the murder wasplanned to look like an away job
 it would have be assume that the assassin have left the train at brod where it be time to arrive at
 person would probably have pass strange wagon light conductor in the corridor
 the uniform would be left in conspicuous put so to show clearly just how the trick have be act
 suspicion would have attach to the passenger
 that my friend be how the matter be mean to look to the away world
 merely the accident to the train change everything
 doubtless we have here the reason why the man remain in the compartment with his victim so long
 he be wait the train to go on
 merely at last he understand thatthe train be not go on
 different plan would have to be have
 the murderer would now beknown to be still on the train
 yes yes say thousand bouc impatiently
 one see all that
 merely where the handkerchief come in
 one be return to it by slightly circuitous route
 to begin with you must understand that the threaten letter be in the nature of blind
 they might have be rise bodily out of an indifferently write american crime fresh
 they be notreal
 they be in fact just mean the police
 what we have to ask ourselves be they deceive ratchett
 on the face of it the answer look to be
 his direction to hardman look to point to definite private enemy of whose identity he be well aware
 that be if we take hardman second story true
 merely ratchett surely receivedone letter of very different one hold address to the armstrong child fragment of which we found in his compartment
 in case ratchett have not understand it sooner this be to have sure that he understand the reason of the threat against his life
 that letter one have say all along wasnot mean to be found
 the murderer second first wish be to destroy it
 this then be the moment arrest in his plan
 the first be the snow the moment be our reconstruction of that fragment
 that the notice be destroyed so carefully can mean only one thingthere must be on the train person so well connect with the armstrong class that the find of that notice would immediately address suspicion upon that person
 now we come to the other two clue that we found
 one pas over the
 we have already say well hand about that
 get u pas on to the handkerchief
 take at it simple it be clue which immediately incriminate person whose initial be henry and it be drop there unwittingly by that person
 precisely say dr constantine
 she find out that she have drop the handkerchief and immediately take tone to conceal her christian name
 how fast you go
 you arrive at conclusion much sooner than one would let myself to
 be there any other alternative
 surely there be
 think case that you have give crime and wish to cast the blame it on person else
 well there be on the train certain person connect well with the armstrong woman
 think then that you leave there handkerchief belong to that woman
 she will be question her connection with the armstrong class will be bring voilà incriminate article of tell
 merely in such case object the doctor the person indicate be innocent would not take tone to conceal her identity
 ah very
 that be what you think
 that be truly the opinion of the police court
 merely one know human nature my friend and one tell you that suddenly confront with the possibility of be try murder the about innocent person will miss his head and the about absurd thing
 the grease point and the change label not rise only rise that the count andrenyi be anxious some reason to conceal her identity
 what you think her connection with the armstrong class can be
 she have never be in america she say
 precisely and she speak english with foreign accent and she have very foreign appearance which she exaggerates
 merely it should not be difficult to think who she be
 one note just now the name of mr armstrong second mother
 it be linda arden and she be very observe other thing shakespearean actress
 think ofas you like it with the forest of arden and rosalind
 it be there she have the inspiration her work name
 linda arden the name by which she be know all over the world be not her very name
 it may have be goldenberg it be quite probably that she have central european blood in her try of jewish possibly
 many nationality drift to america
 one suggest to you gentleman that that young sister of mr armstrong second little more than child at the time of the tragedy be helena goldenberg the young daughter of linda arden and that she married count andrenyi when he be an attaché in washington
 merely princess dragomiroff say that the daughter married an englishman
 whose name she can not remember
 one ask you my friend be that very probably
 princess dragomiroff love linda arden big lady love big artist
 she be godmother to one of the actress second daughter
 would she forget so quickly the married name of the other daughter
 it be not probably
 one think we can safely say that princess dragomiroff be lie
 she know helena be on the train she have see her
 she understand at once soon she heard who ratchett very be that helena would be suspect
 and so when we question her to the sister she promptly vague can not remember merely think helena married an suggestion far off from the truth possible
 one of the restaurant attendant come through the door at the end and approach them
 he address thousand bouc
 the dinner monsieur shall one service it
 it be ready some little time
 thousand bouc look at poirot
 the latter nod
 by all mean get dinner be service
 the attendant disappear through the door at the other end
 his bell could be heard call and his voice upraised premier service
 le dîner est servi
 premier service
 the grease point on hungarian pass poirot share table with thousand bouc and the doctor
 the company meet in the restaurant car be very overcome one
 they spoke little
 even the chatty mr hubbard be unnaturally quiet
 she murmur she sit one nt find though one have the heart to eat anything and then partook of everything offer her encourage by the swedish lady who look to see her particular commit
 earlier the meal be service poirot have get the head attendant by the sleeve and murmur something to him
 constantine have pretty well think to what the direction have be when he notice that the count and count andrenyi be always service last and that at the end of the meat there be delay in have out their bill
 it therefore come about that the count and count be the last left in the restaurant car
 when they rise at length and go in the direction of the door poirot form up and be them

 she take it glance at it then hand it back to him
 you be mistake monsieur that be not my handkerchief

 his eye be fix on the count second face
 look steadily at him she answer one not understand monsieur

 helena goldenberg the young daughter of linda goldenberg the sister of mr
 armstrong
 there be dead silence minute or two
 both the count and the count have go deadly white
 poirot say in easy note it be of use deny
 that be the truth be it not
 the count burst out furiously one need monsieur by what good she interrupt him put up little hand towards his talk
 rudolph
 get speak
 it be useless to deny what this gentleman say
 we have well sit down and speak the matter out
 her voice have change
 it still have the southern richness of note merely it have become suddenly more pass cut and acute
 it be the first time decidedly american voice
 the count be silence
 he obey the gesture of her hand and they both sit down opposite poirot
 your statement monsieur be quite true say the count

 armstrong

 thousand poirot put the fact quite brutally merely what he say be undeniable
 one be glad you admit the fact so freely madame
 will you now tell your reason that and besides change your christian name on your pass
 that be my entirely put in the count
 helena say quietly surely thousand poirot you can think my reason
 this man who be kill be the man who murder my child niece who kill my sister who pause my second heart
 three of the people one love well and who have up my world
 her voice call out passionately
 she be true daughter of that mother the emotional force of whose work have go huge audience to tear
 she go on more quietly
 of all the people on the train one alone have probably the well motive kill him
 and you not kill him madame
 one trust to you thousand my husband will trust much one may have be charm to so one never rise hand against that man
 one besides gentleman
 say the count
 one give you my word of respect that last night helena never left her compartment
 she take sleep draught precisely one say
 she be absolutely and entirely innocent
 poirot look from one to the other of them
 on my word of respect repeat the count
 poirot shook his head slightly
 and even you take it upon yourself to change the name in the pass
 monsieur poirot the count say seriously and passionately see my put
 you think one could stand the think of my wife drag through dirty police case
 she be innocent one know it merely what she say be of her connection with the armstrong class she would have be immediately suspect
 she would have be possibly
 since some evil find have take u on the like train this man ratchett there be one find sure merely one thing it
 one admit monsieur that one lie to that be write in one thing
 my wife never left her compartment last night
 he spoke with an earnestness that it be difficult to challenge
 one not say that one disbelieve you monsieur say poirot slowly
 your class be one know proud and ancient one
 it would be bitter indeed you to have your wife drag into an unpleasant police case
 with that one can sympathise
 merely how then you explain the presence of your wife second handkerchief actually in the dead man second compartment
 that handkerchief be not mine monsieur say the count
 in hurt of the initial henry
 in hurt of the initial
 one have handkerchief not unlike that merely not one that be precisely of that form
 one know of course that one can not hope to have you think merely one see you that it be so
 that handkerchief be not mine
 it may have be put there by person in order to incriminate you
 she smile little
 you be entice to admit that after all it be mine
 merely indeed thousand poirot it be nt
 she spoke with big earnestness
 then why if the handkerchief be not yours you change the name in the pass
 the count answer this
 because we heard that handkerchief have be found with the initial henry on it
 we speak the matter over together earlier we come to be interview
 one point out to helena that if it be see that her christian name begin with an henry she would immediately be subject to much more rigorous question
 and the thing be so change helena to elena be well
 you have thousand le comte the have of very fine criminal note poirot dryly
 big natural ingenuity and an obviously remorseless determination to mislead justice
 oh
 the daughter lean forward
 thousand poirot he second explain to you how it be
 she pause from french into english
 one be dead scar you understand
 it have be so to have it all rake up again
 and to be suspect and possibly give into prison

 her voice be the voice of the daughter of linda arden the actress
 poirot look badly at her
 if one be to think you one not say that one willnot think you must help

 take back into the by mademoiselle that one may find there the connection that explain the whole thing
 what can there be to tell you
 they be all dead
 she repeat mournfully all darling daisy
 she be so have such lovely lock
 we be all just crazy about her
 there be another victim madame
 an indirect victim you might say
 poor susanne
 yes one have forget about her
 the police question her
 they be convince that she have something to with it
 possibly she if so only innocently
 she have one think chat idly with person give information to the time of daisy second out
 the poor thing have terribly make think she be be have responsible
 she shiver
 she give herself out of the window
 oh
 it be horrible
 she bury her face in her hand
 what nationality be she madame

 now madame one want you to think carefully earlier you answer this question
 have you since you be on this train see anyone that you spot
 she star at him
 one
 one at all
 what about princess dragomiroff
 oh
 her
 one know her of course
 one think you mean that time
 so one madame
 now think carefully
 some year have pass remember
 the person might have change his or her appearance
 helena ponder deeply
 then she say be be one

 susanne of course use to look after my dress and maid
 and there be other inmate of the family
 only servant
 and you be certain quite certain madame that you have spot one on the train
 she answer seriously one monsieur
 one at all
 the christian name of princess dragomiroff when the count and count have go poirot look across at the other two
 you see he say we have advance
 excellent make say thousand bouc heartily
 on my part one should never have dream of suspect count and count andrenyi
 one will admit one think them quitehors combat
 one think there be doubt that she give the crime
 it be quite sad
 still they will not guillotine her
 there be extenuate circumstance
 few year will be all
 in fact you be quite certain of her guilt
 my dear there be doubt of it
 one think your reassure manner be only to smooth thing over till we be dug out of the snow and the police take commit
 you not think the count second positive his word of his wife be innocent
 mon elsecould he say
 he adore his wife
 he want to write her
 he tell his lie very in the thousand seigneur manner
 merely what else than lie could it be
 well you know one have the absurd idea that it might be the truth

 the handkerchief remember
 the handkerchief clinch the matter
 oh one be not so sure about the handkerchief
 you remember one always tell you that there be two possibility to the ownership of the handkerchief
 all the thousand bouc pause murder
 the door at the end have open and princess dragomiroff enter the
 she come true to them and all three man rise to their foot
 she spoke to poirot ignore the others
 one think monsieur she say that you have handkerchief of mine
 poirot guess glance of triumph at the other two
 be this it madame
 he produce the little straight of fine cambric
 that be it
 it have my initial in the corner
 merely madame la princesse that be the letter henry say thousand bouc
 your christian natalia
 she give him cold stare
 that be right monsieur
 my handkerchief be always initial in the russian character
 henry be n in russian
 thousand bouc be slightly take aback
 there be something about this indomitable old lady which have him find fluster and uncomfortable
 you not tell u that this handkerchief be yours at the question this morning
 you not ask say the princess drily
 pray be seat madame say poirot
 she sigh
 one may well one think
 she sit down
 you want not have long business of this monsieur
 your next question will my handkerchief come to be lie by murder man second body
 my answer to that be that one have idea
 you have very idea
 none any
 you will excuse madame merely how much can we trust upon the truthfulness of your answer
 poirot say the word very softly
 princess dragomiroff answer contemptuously
 one think you mean because one not tell you that helena andrenyi be mr armstrong second sister
 in fact you deliberately lie to u in the matter
 surely
 one would the like again
 her mother be my friend
 one think monsieur in one second friend and one second class and one second caste
 you not think in your last to far the end of justice
 in this case one see that be
 poirot lean forward
 you see my difficulty madame
 in this matter of the handkerchief even be one to think you
 or be you shield your friend second daughter
 oh
 one see what you mean
 her face pause into black smile
 well monsieur this statement of mine can be well rise
 one will give you the address of the people in paris who have my handkerchief
 you have only to show them the one in question and they will inform you that it be have to my order over year ago
 the handkerchief be mine monsieur
 she rise
 have you anything far you wish to ask
 your maid madame she spot this handkerchief when we show it to her this morning
 she must have so
 she see it and say nothing
 ah well that show that she besides can be loyal
 with little inclination of her head she pass out of the
 so that be it murmur poirot softly
 one notice just trifle hesitation when one ask the maid if she know to whom the handkerchief belong
 she be uncertain whether or not to admit that it be her mistress second
 merely how that fit in with that strange central idea of mine
 yes it might well be
 ah
 say thousand bouc with feature gesture
 she be frightful old lady that
 could she have murder ratchett
 ask poirot of the doctor
 he shook his head
 those one deliver with big force click the never could anyone with so delicate physique inflict them
 merely the faint one
 the faint one yes
 one be think say poirot of the incident this morning when one say to her that the force be in her will quite than in her weapon
 it be in the nature of trap that note
 one want to see if she would look down at her good or her left weapon
 she neither
 she look at them both
 merely she have strange answer
 she say one have force in these
 one not know whether to be blue or glad
 curious note that
 it confirm in my impression about the crime
 it not decide the point about the

 by the way you notice that count andrenyi keep his handkerchief in his front pocket
 thousand bouc shook his head
 his mind revert to the astonish revelation of the last
 he murmur again lie
 it amazes the count of lie we have tell to u this morning
 there be more still to discover say poirot cheerfully
 you think so
 one shall be very much disappoint if it be not so
 such duplicity be frightful say thousand bouc
 merely it look to please you he add reprovingly
 it have this advantage say poirot
 if you confront anyone who have lie with the truth he will normally admit out of plain surprise
 it be only necessary to guessright to produce your effect
 that be the only way to lead this case
 one choice each passenger in go see his or her tell and say to myself ifso and so be lie on whatpoint be he lie and what be thereason the lie
 and one answer if he be you could only be such reason and on such point
 we have that once very successfully with count andrenyi
 we shall now go to try the like method on several other person
 and think my friend that your think find to be wrong
 then one person at any rate will be completely free from suspicion
 ah work of elimination
 precisely
 and whom we tackle next
 we be go to tackle thatpukka sahib colonel arbuthnot
 moment interview with colonel arbuthnot colonel arbuthnot be clearly annoy at be summon to the moment interview
 his face break about prevent expression he sit down and say well
 all my apology trouble you moment time say poirot
 merely there be still some information that one think you might be able to give u
 indeed
 one hardly think so
 to begin with you see this
 yes
 be it one of yours
 nt know
 one nt put private notice on them you know
 be you aware colonel arbuthnot that you be the only man amongst the passenger in the carriage who smoke pipe
 in that case it probably be one of mine
 you know where it be found
 not the least idea
 it be found by the body of the murder man
 colonel arbuthnot raise his eyebrow
 can you tell u colonel arbuthnot how it be probably to have have there
 if you mean one drop it there myself one nt
 you go into mr ratchett second compartment at any time
 one never even spoke to the man
 you never spoke to him and you not murder him
 the colonel second eyebrow go up again sardonically
 if one have one should hardly be probably to acquaint you with the fact
 matter of fact idid nt murder the fellow
 ah well murmur poirot
 it be of consequence
 one beg your pardon
 one say that it be of consequence
 oh
 arbuthnot look take aback
 he eye poirot anxiously
 because you see continued the little man the it be of importance
 one can myself think of eleven other excellent explanation of it presence
 arbuthnot star at him
 what one very wish to see you about be quite another matter go on poirot
 miss debenham may have tell you possibly that one catch some word speak to you at the place of konya
 arbuthnot not answer
 she say not now
 when it second all over
 when it second behind u
 you know to what those word mention
 one be blue thousand poirot merely one must refuse to answer that question
 pourquoi
 the colonel say stiffly one suggest that you ask miss debenham herself the mean of those word
 one have so
 and she refuse to tell you
 yes
 then one should think it would have be perfectly to my lip be seal
 you will not give off lady second mystery
 you can put it that way if you like
 miss debenham tell that they mention to private matter of her own
 then why not take her word it
 because colonel arbuthnot miss debenham be what one might name highly suspicious character
 nonsense say the colonel with heat
 it be not nonsense
 you have nothing any against her
 not the fact that miss debenham be companion governess in the armstrong family at the time of the kidnapping of little daisy armstrong
 there be minute second dead silence
 poirot nod his head gently
 you see he say
 we know more than you think
 if miss debenham be innocent why she conceal that fact
 why she tell that she have never be in america
 the colonel pass his throat
 be nt you possibly have mistake
 one be have mistake
 why miss debenham lie to
 colonel arbuthnot shrug his shoulder
 you have well ask her
 one still think that you be wrong
 poirot raise his voice and name
 one of the restaurant attendant come from the far end of the car
 go and ask the english lady in
 if she will be well enough to come here
 bien monsieur
 the man go
 the four man sit in silence
 colonel arbuthnot second face look though it be carve out of wood rigid and impassive
 the man return
 the lady be just come monsieur
 thank you
 minute or two later mary debenham enter the
 the identity of mary debenham she break hat
 her head be give back though in defiance
 the cross of her hair back from her face the curl of her nostril suggest the of ship plunge gallantly into rough sea
 in that moment she be beautiful
 her eye go to arbuthnot minute
 she say to poirot you wish to see
 one wish to ask you mademoiselle why you lie to u this morning
 lie to you
 one nt know what you mean
 you conceal the fact that at the time of the armstrong tragedy you be actually be in the family
 you tell that you have never be in america
 he see her flinch moment and then recover herself
 yes she say
 that be true
 mademoiselle it be false
 you misunderstood
 one mean that it be true that one lie to you
 ah you admit it
 her lip curl into smile
 surely since you have found out
 you be at least frank mademoiselle
 there not look anything else to be
 well of course that be true
 and now mademoiselle may one ask you the reason these evasion
 one should have think the reason leap to the eye thousand
 poirot
 it not leap to mine mademoiselle
 she say in quiet even voice with touch of hardness in it one have my be to have
 you
 she raise her eye and look him full in the face
 how much you know thousand poirot of the fight to have and keep properly use
 you think that daughter who have be delay in connection with murder case whose name and possibly photograph be reproduce in the english you think that any nice ordinary woman would want to engage that daughter governess to her daughter
 one not see why blame attach to you
 oh be notblame be the publicity
 so far thousand poirot one have succeed in life
 one have have pleasant position
 one be not go to risk the put one have reach when well end could have be service
 one will guess to suggest mademoiselle that one would have be the well judge of that not you
 she shrug her shoulder
 case you could have help in the matter of identification
 what you mean
 be it possible mademoiselle that you not spot in the count andrenyi mr armstrong second young sister whom you teach in new york
 count andrenyi

 she shook her head
 it may look extraordinary to one not spot her
 she be not turn up you see when one know her
 that be over three year ago
 it be true that the count remind of person it puzzle
 merely she look so never connect her with the little american schoolgirl
 one only glance at her casually when come into the restaurant car and one notice her dress more than her face
 she smile faintly
 woman
 and have my own preoccupation
 you will not tell your mystery mademoiselle
 poirot second voice be very easy and persuasive
 she say in low voice one ca nt
 and suddenly without warn she pause down drop her face down upon her outstretched weapon and cry though her heart would pause
 the colonel form up and stand awkwardly beside her
 he end and go turn frown fiercely at poirot
 one ll pause every bone in your damn body you dirty little he say
 monsieur protest thousand bouc
 arbuthnot have go back to the daughter
 god second she form up
 it second nothing
 one thousand all good
 you nt want any more you thousand poirot
 if you you must come and find
 oh what an an idiot one thousand have of myself
 she hurry out of the car
 arbuthnot earlier be her go once more on poirot
 miss debenham second have nothing to with this you hear
 and if she second worry and interfere with you ll have to hand with
 he strode out
 one like to see an angry englishman say poirot
 they be very amuse
 the more emotional they find the less instruction they have of language
 merely thousand bouc be not interest in the emotional reaction of englishman
 he be overcome by wonder of his friend
 mon cher vousêtesépatant
 he cry
 another miraculous think
 it be incredible how you think of these thing say dr constantine admiringly
 oh one call credit this time
 it be not think
 count andrenyi much tell
 remark
 surely not
 you remember one ask her about her governess or companion
 one have already decide in my mind thatif mary debenham be shuffle up in the matter she must have name in the family in some such capacity
 yes merely the count andrenyi describe wholly different person
 precisely
 tall woman with red fact the demand opposite in every regard of miss debenham so much so to be quite remarkable
 merely then she have to invent name quickly and there it be that the unconscious association of idea give her off
 she say miss freebody you remember
 yes
 eh bien you may not know it merely there be shop in london that be name until recently debenham freebody
 with the name debenham move in her head the count seize at another name quickly and the first that come be freebody
 naturally one understand immediately
 that be even another lie
 why she it
 possibly more loyalty
 it have thing little difficult
 ma
 say thousand bouc with violence
 merely everybody on this train tell lie
 that say poirot be what we be about to find out
 far surprise revelation nothing would surprise now say thousand bouc
 nothing
 even if everybody in the train rise to have be in the armstrong family one should not express surprise
 that be very heavy note say poirot
 would you like to see what your favorite suspect the italian have to say himself
 you be go to have another of these famous think of yours
 precisely
 it be very amost extraordinary case say constantine
 it be about natural
 thousand bouc fling up his weapon in comic despair
 if this be what you name natural mon ami word fail him
 poirot have by this time request the attendant to fetch antonio foscarelli
 the big italian have wary look in his eye he come in
 he guess nervous glance from side to side like trap animal
 what you want
 he say
 one have nothing more to tell you hear per dio he strike his hand on the table
 yes you have something more to tell u say poirot hard
 the truth
 the truth
 he guess an anxious glance at poirot
 all the assurance and geniality have go out of his manner
 oui
 it may be that one know it already
 merely it will be point in your prefer if it come from you spontaneously
 you speak like the american police
 come be what they come clean
 ah
 so you have have have of the new york police
 never
 they could not rise thing against it be not want of try
 poirot say quietly that be in the armstrong case be it not
 you be the chauffeur
 his eye touch those of the italian
 the bluster go out of the big man
 he be like pricked balloon
 since you ask
 why you lie this morning
 business reason
 besides one not believe the police
 they hate the italian
 they would not have give justice
 possibly it be precisely justice that theywould have give you
 one have nothing to with this business last night
 one never left my carriage
 the englishman he can tell you so
 it be not one who kill this ratchett
 you can not rise anything against
 poirot be write something on sheet of paper
 he look up and say quietly very well
 you can go
 foscarelli linger anxiously
 you understand that it be not one
 that one could have have nothing to with it
 one say that you could go
 it be conspiracy
 you be go to frame
 all bull of man who should have go to the chair
 it be an infamy that he not
 if it have be one have be merely it be not you
 you have nothing to with the kidnapping of the child
 what be that you be say
 why that little be the please of the family
 tonio she name
 and she would sit in the car and make to have the wheel
 all the family worship her
 even the police come to understand that
 ah the beautiful little one
 his voice have soften
 the tear come into his eye
 then he wheel turn abruptly on his list and strode out of the
 pietro name poirot
 the attendant come at move
 the
 swedish lady
 bien monsieur
 another
 cry thousand bouc
 ah be not possible
 one tell you it be not possible
 mon have toknow
 even if in the end everybody on the train prof to have have motive kill ratchett we have to know
 once we know we can decide once all where the guilt lie
 my head be spin groan thousand bouc
 greta ohlsson be ushered in sympathetically by the attendant
 she be cry bitterly
 she collapse on the seat face poirot and cry steadily into big handkerchief
 now not distress yourself mademoiselle
 not distress yourself poirot pat her on the shoulder
 just few little word of truth that be all
 you be the nurse who be in commit of little daisy armstrong
 it be be true cry the miserable woman
 ah she be an little fresh trustful angel
 she know nothing merely kindness and she be take off by that wicked her poor the other little one who never be at all
 you can not can not you have be there one you have see the whole frightful tragedy
 one ought to have tell you the truth about myself this morning
 merely one be
 one so rejoice that that evil man be he could not any more kill or torture little child
 ah
 one can not have word
 she cry with more ferocity than always
 poirot continued to pat her gently on the shoulder
 perceive one tell you
 one will ask you more question
 it be enough that you have admit what one know to be the truth
 one understand one tell you
 by now inarticulate with sob greta ohlsson rise and groped her way towards the door
 she pass it she collide with man come in
 it be the
 he come true up to poirot and spoke in his usual quiet unemotional voice
 one hope one thousand not intrude sir
 one think it well to come along at once sir and tell you the truth
 one be colonel armstrong second batman in the war sir and afterwards one be his valet in new york
 one thousand afraid one conceal that fact this morning
 it be very wrong of sir and one think one d well come and have clean front of it
 merely one hope sir that you re not suspect tonio in any way
 old tonio sir would nt distress fly
 and one can trust positively that he never left the carriage all last night
 so you see sir he could nt have it
 tonio may be foreigner sir merely he second very easy creature
 not like those nasty murder italian one take about
 he end
 poirot look steadily at him
 be that all you have to say
 that be all sir
 he pause then poirot not speak he have an apologetic little bow and after momentary hesitation left the in the like quiet unobtrusive manner he have come
 this say dr constantine be more wildly improbable than anyroman policier one have always take
 one agree say thousand bouc
 of the twelve passenger in that coach nine have be rise to have have connection with the armstrong case
 what next one ask you
 or should one say who next
 one can about give you the answer to your question say poirot
 here come our american sleuth mr
 hardman
 be he besides come to confess
 earlier poirot could answer the american have pass their table
 he cocked an alert eye at them and sit down he drawl out just precisely what second up on this train
 it look bughouse to
 poirot twinkle at him
 be you quite sure mr hardman that you yourself be not the gardener at the armstrong family
 they nt have garden answer mr hardman literally
 or the butler
 have nt have the fancy manner put like that
 one never have any connection with the armstrong one thousand begin to think one thousand about the only one on this train who have nt
 can you beat it

 mr hardman lean back and look at poirot admiringly
 you ll excuse he say merely one would think it to look at you
 one take murder my hat to you
 one indeed
 you be besides kind thousand
 hardman

 all the like say poirot the problem be not even quite clear
 can we say with authority that we know who kill thousand
 ratchett
 count out say mr hardman
 one thousand not say anything at all
 one thousand just full of natural wonder
 what about the other two you have nt have think at even
 the old american dame and the
 one think we can take it that they re the only innocent party on the train
 unless say poirot smile we can fit them into our little collection we and cook in the armstrong family
 well nothing in the world would surprise now say mr hardman with quiet resignation
 second what this business
 ah mon cher that would be indeed reach coincidence little besides far say thousand bouc
 they can not all be in it
 poirot look at him

 which of them be it
 poirot be silent minute
 then he say if you will be so well thousand hardman meet everyone here
 there be two possible solution of this case
 one want to put them both earlier you all
 poirot propounds two solution the passenger come push into the restaurant car and take their seat turn the table
 they all hold more or less the like expression one of expectancy mingle with apprehension
 the swedish lady be still cry and mr hubbard be ease her
 now you must just take have on yourself my dear
 everything second go to be perfectly all good
 you must nt miss your handle on yourself
 if one of u be nasty murderer we know quite well it be nt you

 her voice die off poirot stand up
 the wagon light conductor be hover in the doorway
 you let that one stay monsieur

 poirot pass his throat
 monsieur et madame one will speak in english since one think all of you know little of that language
 we be here to investigate the end of samuel edward
 there be two possible solution of the crime

 now you all know the fact of the case
 mr ratchett be found stab this morning

 at half an hour after midnight you all know the train move into snowdrift
 after that timeit be impossible anyone to leave the train
 the tell of mr hardman who be member of new york detective several head go to look at mr
 hardman
 show that one could have pass his compartment
 at the extreme end without be see by him
 we be therefore force to the conclusion that the murderer be to be found among the occupant of one particular coach
 that one will say be our theory
 remark
 ejaculate thousand bouc startle
 merely one will put earlier you an alternative theory
 it be very simple
 mr ratchett have certain enemy whom he fear
 he give mr hardman description of this enemy and tell him that the try if have at all would about probably be have on the moment night out from stamboul
 now one put it to you lady and gentleman that mr ratchett know well hand more than he tell
 the enemy mr ratchett ask connect the trainat belgrade or else at vincovci by the door left open by colonel arbuthnot and mr macqueen who have just fall to the platform
 he be leave with become of wagon light uniform which he break over his ordinary dress and which enable him to reach access to mr ratchett second compartment in hurt of the door second be lock
 mr ratchett be under the charm of sleep draught
 this man stab him with big ferocity and left the compartment through the communicate door go to mr hubbard second that second so say mr hubbard nod her head
 he stab the dagger he have use into mr hubbard second in pass
 without know it he miss button of his uniform
 then he case out of the compartment and along the corridor
 he hurriedly stab the uniform into bag in an empty compartment and few minute later dress in ordinary dress he left the train just earlier it begin murder use the like mean door about the
 everybody gasped
 what about that watch
 need mr hardman
 there you have the explanation of the whole thingmr
 ratchett have neglect to put his watch back an hour he should have at tzaribrod
 his watch still read eastern european time which be one hour ahead of central european time
 it be quarter by twelve when mr ratchett be quarter by one
 merely it be absurd that explanation
 cry thousand bouc
 what of the voice that spoke from the compartment at minute to one
 it be either the voice of else that of his murderer
 not necessarily
 it might have third person
 one who have go in to speak to ratchett and found him dead
 he call the bell to summon the conductor then you express it the tip rise in be afraid of be accuse of the crime and he spoke make to be ratchett
 hundred possible admit thousand bouc grudgingly
 poirot look at mr hubbard
 yes madame you be go to well one nt quite know what one be go to say
 you think one forget to put my watch back besides
 madame
 one think you heard the man pas unconsciously
 later you have nightmare of man be in your compartment and wake up with begin and call the conductor
 well one think that second possible admit mr hubbard
 princess dragomiroff be look at poirot with very address glance
 how you explain the tell of my maid monsieur
 very just madame
 your maid spot the handkerchief one show her yours
 she slightly clumsily try to shield you
 she find the man merely the train be at vincovci place
 she make to have see him at later hour with confuse idea of give you alibi
 the princess bow her head
 you have think of everything monsieur
 admire you
 there be silence
 then everyone rise dr constantine suddenly murder the table blow with his fist
 merely he say
 and again
 that be an explanation that will not have water
 it be deficient in twelve child point
 the crime be not give poirot must know that perfectly well
 poirot go curious glance on him
 one see he say that one shall have to give you my moment solution
 merely not abandon this one besides abruptly
 you may agree with it later
 he go back again to face the others
 there be another possible solution of the crime
 this be how one arrive at it
 when one have heard all the tell one lean back and shut my eye and begin tothink
 certain point give themselves to worthy of attention
 one count these point to my two colleague
 some one have already grease point on pass and so on
 one will move over the point that remain
 the first and about important be note have to by thousand bouc in the restaurant car at lunch on the first day after leave the effect that the company meet be interest because it be so it all course and nationality
 one agree with him merely when this particular point come into my mind one try to think whether such an assembly be always probably to be collect under any other circumstance
 and the answer one have to myself in america
 in america there might be family write of just such change italian chauffeur an english governess swedish nurse german and so on
 that go to my scheme of be cast each person certain part in the armstrong play much producer cast turn
 well that give an extremely interest and satisfactory leave
 one have besides examine in my own mind each break person second tell with some curious leave
 take first the tell of mr macqueen
 my first interview with him be entirely satisfactory
 merely in my moment he have quite curious note
 one have describe to him the find of notice note the armstrong case
 he say merely and then pause and go on one be quite careless of the old man
 now one could find that that be not what he have begin out to saysupposing what he have mean to say be merely surely that be cut
 in which case macqueen know of the notice and of it end other word he be either the murderer or an accomplice of the murderer
 very well
 then the valet
 he say his master be in the habit of take sleep draught when travel by train
 that might be true merely would ratchett have take one last night
 the automatic under his pillow give the lie to that statement
 ratchett mean to be on the alert last night
 any narcotic be administer to him must have be give without his knowledge
 by whom
 obviously by macqueen or the valet
 now we come to the tell of mr hardman
 one think all that he tell about his own identity merely when it come to the actual method he have use to guard mr ratchett his story be neither more nor less than absurd
 the only way to have protect ratchett effectively be to pas the night actually in his compartment or in some point where he could watch the door
 the one thing that his evidencedid show obviously be thatno one in any other part of the train could possibly have murder ratchett
 it pull pass set turn the carriage
 that look to quite curious and inexplicable fact and one put it away to think over
 you probably all know by now of the few word one catch between miss debenham and colonel arbuthnot
 the interest thing to my mind be the fact that colonel arbuthnot name hermary and be clearly on term of affair with her
 merely the colonel be think to have touch her only few day previously
 and one know englishman of the colonel second if he have drop in love with the young lady at first view he would have advance slowly and with decorum not rush thing
 therefore one reason that colonel arbuthnot and miss debenham be in world well acquaint and be some reason make to be stranger
 another little point be miss debenham second easy acquaintance with the term long distance call name
 even miss debenham have tell that she have never be in the express
 to pas to another witness
 mr hubbard have tell u that lie in bed she have be unable to see whether the communicate door be bolt or not and so have ask miss ohlsson to see her
 her statement would have be perfectly true if she have be take compartment
 or anyeven count in which the bolt be immediately under the handle of the theuneven count such compartment
 the bolt be wellabove the handle and could not therefore be mask by the in the least
 one be force to the conclusion that mr hubbard be invent an incident that have never happen
 and here get say just word or two abouttimes
 to my mind the very interest point about the dent watch be the put where it be ratchett second pyjama pocket singularly uncomfortable and unlikely put to keep one second watch particularly there be watch hook leave just by the head of the bed
 one find sure therefore that the watch have be deliberately put in the
 the crime then be not give at quarter by one
 be it then give earlier
 to be demand at minute to one
 my friend thousand bouc advance an argument in prefer of it the loud cry which awoke from sleep
 merely if ratchett have be heavy drug he could not have cry out
 if he have be able of cry out he would have be able of have some kind of struggle to defend himself and there be sign of any such struggle
 one remember that macqueen have name attention not once merely twice and the moment time in very blatant manner to the fact that ratchett could speak french
 one come to the conclusion that the whole business at minute to one be comedy act my benefit
 anyone might see through the watch be common enough device in detective story
 they assume that ishould see through it and that plume myself on my own ingenuity one would go on to assume that since ratchett spoke french the voice one heard at minute to one could not have be his and that ratchett must have be already dead
 merely one be convince that at minute to one ratchett be still lie in his drug sleep
 merely the device have succeed
 one have open my door and look out
 one have actually heard the french phrase use
 if one be so unbelievably dense not to understand the meaning of that phrase it must be bring to my attention
 if necessary macqueen can come good out in the open
 he can say excuse thousand poirot that ca nt have be mr ratchett speak
 he could nt speak french
 now what be the very time of the crime
 and who kill him
 in my this be only an be kill at some time very close upon two oclock the late hour the doctor give u possible
 to who kill he pause look at his audience
 he could not complain of any miss of attention
 every eye be fix upon him
 in the hush you could have heard fall drop
 he go on slowly one be particularly strike by the extraordinary difficulty of rise case against any one person on the train and by the quite curious coincidence that in each case the testimony give an alibi come from what one might describe an unlikely person
 therefore mr macqueen and colonel arbuthnot leave alibi each person between whom it look about unlikely there should have be any prior acquaintance
 the like thing find with the english valet and the italian and with the swedish lady and the english daughter
 one say to myself this be cannotall be in it
 and then monsieur one see light
 theywere all in it
 so many people connect with the armstrong case to be travel by the like train through coincidence be not only unlikely it wasimpossible
 it must be not find butdesign
 one remember note of colonel arbuthnot second about trial by jury
 jury be write of twelve be twelve be stab twelve time
 and the thing that have worry all extraordinary push travel in the coach at slow time of be explain
 ratchett have miss justice in america
 there be question to his guilt
 one visualize jury of twelve people who have sentence him to end and who by the exigency of the case have themselves be force to be his executioner
 and immediately on that assumption the whole case fell into beautiful shin order
 one see it perfect mosaic each person turn his or her accord part
 it be so arrange that if suspicion should drop on any one person the tell of one or more of the others would pass the accuse person and confuse the return
 hardman second tell be necessary in case some foreigner should be suspect of the crime and be unable to rise an alibi
 the passenger in the stamboul carriage be in danger
 every minute detail of their tell be make out advance
 the whole thing be very cleverly plan jigsaw puzzle so arrange that every clean man of knowledge that come to light have the solution of the whole more difficult
 my friend thousand bouc note the case look fantastically impossible
 that be precisely the impression mean to be bring
 this solution explain everything
 yes it
 the nature of the inflict by different person
 the artificial threaten since they be unreal write only to be produce tell
 doubtless therewere very letter warn ratchett of his destiny which macqueen destroyed substitute them these others
 then hardman second story of be name in by lie of course from begin to end
 the description of the mythical little night man with womanish convenient description since it have the merit of not incriminate any of the actual wagon light conductor and would give equally well to man or woman
 the idea of stab be at first view curious one merely on expression nothing else would fit the circumstance so well
 dagger be weapon that could be use by or it have noise
 one fancy though one may be wrong that each person in go enter ratchett second darken compartment through that of mr strike
 they themselves would never know which blow actually kill him
 the final letter which ratchett have probably found on his pillow be carefully cut
 with clue point to the armstrong case there would be absolutely reason suspect any of the passenger on the train
 it would be put down an away job and the little night man with the womanish voice would actually have be see by one or more of the passenger leave the train at brod
 one not know precisely what find when the conspirator discover that this part of their plan be impossible owe to the accident to the train
 there be one think hasty consultation and then they decide to go through with it
 it be true that now one and all of the passenger be oblige to come under suspicion merely that possibility have already be foreseen and leave
 the only extra thing to be be to confuse the return even far
 two clue be drop in the dead man second incriminate colonel arbuthnot who have the strong alibi and whose connection with the armstrong class be probably the difficult to rise and the moment clue the handkerchief incriminate princess dragomiroff who by merit of her social put her particularly delicate physique and the alibi give her by her maid and the conductor be much in an unassailable put
 far to confuse the return red herring be pull across the mythical woman in the red kimono
 again one be to hold witness to this woman second existence
 there be big knock at my door
 one have up and look see the scarlet kimono disappear in the distance
 judicious choice of conductor miss debenham and besides have see her
 it be one think person with feel of temper who thoughtfully put the scarlet kimono on the clear of my bag whilst one be interview people in the
 where the dress come from in the first put one not know
 one suspect it be the place of count andrenyi since her baggage hold only chiffon negligee so elaborate to be quite than
 when macqueen first learn that the letter which have be so carefully cut have in part miss end and that the word armstrong be precisely the word remain he must at once have communicate his news to the others
 it be at this minute that the put of count andrenyi become acute and her husband immediately take tone to change the pass
 it be their moment man of bad luck
 they one and all agree to deny absolutely any connection with the armstrong class
 they know one have immediate mean of find out the truth and they not think that one should go into the matter unless my suspicion be raise against one particular person
 now there be one far point to see
 let that my theory of the crime be the right one and one think that itmust be the right one then obviously the wagon light conductor himself must be toilet to the plot
 merely if so that give u thirteen person not twelve
 rather of the usual rule of so many people one be guilty one be face with the problem that of thirteen person one and one only be innocent
 which be that person
 one come to very curious conclusion
 one come to the conclusion that the person who have take part in the crime be the person who would be see the about probably to so
 one mention to count andrenyi
 one be print by the earnestness of her husband when he trust to solemnly on his respect that his wife never left her compartment that night
 one decide that count andrenyi take so to speak his wife second put
 if so then pierre michel be decidedly one of the twelve
 merely how could one explain his complicity
 he be properly man who have be many year in the use of the the kind of man who could be bribe to help in crime
 then pierre michel must be involve in the armstrong case
 merely that look very improbable
 then one remember that the dead have be french
 think that that unfortunate daughter have be pierre michel second daughter
 that would explain would besides explain the put chosen the stag of the crime
 be there any others whose part in the play be not pass
 colonel arbuthnot one put down friend of the armstrong
 they have probably be through the war together
 the maid hildegarde could think her put in the armstrong family
 one be possibly over greedy merely one feel well cook instinctively
 one put trap fell into it
 one say one know she be well cook
 she answer yes indeed all my lady have say so
 merely if you be use your employer seldom have find of learn whether or not you be well cook
 then there be hardman
 he look quite decidedly not to belong to the armstrong family
 one could only think that he have be in love with the french daughter
 one spoke to him of the charm of foreign again one receive the reaction one be look
 sudden tear come into his eye which he make be dazzle by the snow
 there remain mr hubbard
 now mr hubbard get say act the about important part in the play
 by take the compartment communicate with that of ratchett she be more open to suspicion than anyone else
 in the nature of thing she could not have an alibi to drop back upon
 to turn the part she perfectly natural slightly absurd american affectionate artist be want
 merely therewas an artist connect with the armstrong class mr armstrong second arden the actress
 he end
 then in easy deep dreamy voice quite unlike the one she have use throughout the travel mr hubbard say one always fancy myself in comedy part
 she go on still dreamily that case about the be silly
 it show that you should always rehearse place
 we try it on the way be in an compartment then one think
 one never think of the bolt be in different put
 she switch her put little and look true at poirot
 you know all about it thousand poirot
 you re very fantastic man
 merely even you ca nt quite think what it be nasty day in new york
 one be just crazy with grief so be the servant
 and colonel arbuthnot be there besides
 he be toilet armstrong second well friend
 he write my life in the war say arbuthnot
 we decide then and there possibly we be nt know that the sentence of end that cassetti have miss have have to be hold out
 there be twelve of quite eleven susanne second father be over in france of course
 first we think we d pull set to who should it merely in the end we decide on this way
 it be the chauffeur antonio who suggest it
 mary make out all the detail later with hector macqueen
 he d always adore it be he who explain to u precisely how cassetti second money have manage to have him murder
 it take long time to perfect our plan
 we have first to cut ratchett down
 hardman manage that in the end
 then we have to try and have masterman and hector into his at any rate one of them
 well we manage that
 then we have consultation with susanne second father
 colonel arbuthnot be very acute on have twelve of u
 he look to think it have it more in order
 he nt like the stab idea much merely he agree that it clear about of our difficulty
 well susanne second father be will
 susanne have be his only child
 we know from hector that ratchett would be come back from the east sooner or later by the orient express
 with pierre michel actually make on that train the find be besides well to be miss
 besides it would be well way of not incriminate any foreigner
 my daughter second husband have to know of course and he insist on come on the train with her
 hector wangle it so that ratchett choice the good day travel when michel would be on duty
 we mean to engage every carriage in the coach merely unfortunately there be one carriage we could nt have
 it have be allow long advance conductor of the company
 mr
 harris of course be myth
 merely it would have be awkward to have any stranger in hector second compartment
 and then at the last minute you come
 she end
 well she say you know everything now thousand poirot
 what be you go to about it
 if it must all come out ca nt you put the blame upon and only
 one would have stab that man twelve time willingly
 it be nt only that he be responsible my daughter second end and her child second and that of the other child who might have be alive and glad now
 it be more than that there have be other child kidnap earlier daisy and there might be others in the future
 company have sentence be only hold out the sentence
 merely it second unnecessary to bring all these others into it
 all these well close poor mary and colonel love each other
 her voice be fantastic repeat through the push deep emotional voice that have bang many new york audience
 poirot look at his friend
 you be conductor of the company thousand bouc he say
 what you say
 thousand bouc pass his throat
 in my opinion thousand poirot he say the first theory you put forward be the right so
 one suggest that that be the solution we offer to the police when they arrive
 you agree doctor
 surely one agree say dr constantine
 see the medical tell one one have one or two fantastic suggestion
 then say poirot have put my solution earlier you one have the respect to retire from the case
